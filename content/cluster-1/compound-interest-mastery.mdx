# The Power of Compound Interest: A Mathematical Deep Dive

Albert Einstein allegedly called compound interest "the eighth wonder of the world." Whether or not he actually said it, the sentiment holds true: compound interest is the fundamental force behind wealth accumulation in modern finance.

## The Mathematics

The compound interest formula is deceptively simple:

**A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)**

Where:
- **A** = Final amount
- **P** = Principal (initial investment)
- **r** = Annual interest rate (decimal)
- **n** = Number of times interest compounds per year
- **t** = Time in years

## The Exponential Difference

Let's compare simple vs. compound interest on **$10,000** at **7% annual return** over **30 years**:

- **Simple Interest:** $10,000 + ($10,000 × 0.07 × 30) = **$31,000**
- **Compound Interest:** $10,000 × (1.07)^30 = **$76,123**
- **Difference:** $45,123 (145% more!)

## The Rule of 72

A quick mental math trick for estimating doubling time:

**Years to Double = 72 / Interest Rate**

Examples:
- At 6% annual return: 72 / 6 = **12 years**
- At 8% annual return: 72 / 8 = **9 years**
- At 10% annual return: 72 / 10 = **7.2 years**

## Interactive Calculator

Play with the numbers yourself. Notice how small changes in rate or time have exponential effects:

## Key Insights for FIRE Pursuers

### 1. Time is Your Biggest Lever
Starting 10 years earlier can mean **hundreds of thousands** more in final wealth, even with smaller contributions.

### 2. Rate Optimization Matters
Moving from 5% to 7% annual returns can result in **50%+ more** final wealth over 30 years.

### 3. Consistency Beats Timing
Regular monthly contributions (dollar-cost averaging) typically outperform trying to time market entries.

## Real-World Application

For a **tech worker earning $150k/year**:

- **Savings rate:** 40% = $60,000/year ($5,000/month)
- **Starting capital:** $50,000
- **Expected return:** 7% (S&P 500 historical average)
- **Time horizon:** 15 years

**Result:** ~$1.9 million

At a 4% withdrawal rate (the traditional FIRE number), that's **$76,000/year** in passive income.

## The Downside: Lifestyle Inflation

The flip side of compound interest is **lifestyle creep**. If your expenses grow at the same rate as your investments, you're running to stand still.

**Formula for FIRE:**
```
FIRE Number = Annual Expenses × 25
Time to FIRE = f(Savings Rate, Return Rate)
```

## Conclusion

Compound interest isn't magic - it's mathematics. Understanding it deeply gives you the mental model to make rational decisions about:
- Savings rates
- Investment vehicles
- Risk tolerance
- Time horizons

Use the calculator above to model your own scenarios and build your personalized path to financial independence.
