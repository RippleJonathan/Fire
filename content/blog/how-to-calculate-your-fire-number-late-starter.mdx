I've been building toward FIRE while running a small business, and when I turned 40 the math felt different than the usual 20s-and-30s advice.
This post walks through a practical way to calculate a FIRE number when you're starting later — with conservative examples you can actually act on.

**Quick TL;DR:**
- **FIRE number =** annual spending × withdrawal rate multiplier (usually 25× for 4% rule). For late starters, treat the multiplier conservatively (20–23×) and factor in slower accumulation time.
- **Actionable steps:** calculate true annual spending, choose a realistic withdrawal rate, model time-to-FIRE under different savings rates, and consider hybrid strategies (partial portfolio, side hustles, part-time work).

**Why the usual advice sounds wrong when you're starting late**

Most FIRE content assumes decades of compound growth and plenty of time to recover from market drops. If you’re starting at 35–50, time horizon shortens and sequence of returns risk matters more. That doesn't mean FIRE is impossible — it means the math and plan need to be more conservative and practical.

Step 1 — Figure out your true annual spending

- Use the past 12 months of bank and credit-card statements.
- Include irregular big items (car, property taxes, health costs) averaged over several years.
- Add a line for healthcare premium increases if you’ll be between jobs and uninsured for a while.

Example (single household):
- Housing (mortgage + insurance + HOA): $18,000
- Utilities + phone + internet: $3,000
- Groceries + eating out: $6,000
- Transportation: $4,000
- Medical (out-of-pocket/insurance premium top-ups): $6,000
- Misc (tools, subscriptions, travel): $6,000
- Total annual spending = $43,000

Step 2 — Pick a withdrawal rate and multiplier

- Classic 4% rule → 25× multiplier (safe for long horizons)
- Late starter conservative choice: 4.5% −> multiplier ~22.2× or 5% → 20× (but 5% has higher risk)

For our example: $43,000 × 22 = $946,000 (target portfolio for 4.5% WR)

Step 3 — Model time-to-FIRE with your current savings rate

- Start with current investable assets.
- Add annual net savings (after taxes and business reinvestment).
- Choose an expected nominal return (e.g., 6% realistic long-term after inflation for balanced portfolio) but run scenarios at 4% and 8% too.

Quick formula (approximate, annual compounding):
Future Value after n years = current_assets × (1+r)^n + annual_savings × [((1+r)^n - 1)/r]

Example: current $150k, save $30k/year, r=6% → how many years to reach $946k? (Use the calculator on the site.)

Step 4 — Reduce risk, add flexibility

- Build a partial FIRE first: secure a base that covers essential expenses (housing + food + insurance) through dividends or a conservative bond ladder.
- Consider hybrid retirement: part-time work, contract income, or sell skills (consulting, courses).
- Ramp up emergency and healthcare buffers — these cost more if you leave employer health plans.

Step 5 — Tax-aware saving accelerates progress

- Max employer plans and tax-advantaged accounts first: Roth or Traditional based on your expected tax change (discussed in another post).
- Use SEP/Solo 401(k) if self-employed — high contribution limits accelerate compounding.

Real example scenarios (compact):

- Scenario A: current $200k, save $40k/yr, r=6% → ~7.5 years to $946k
- Scenario B: current $100k, save $30k/yr, r=6% → ~13 years to $946k
- Scenario C: current $250k, save $20k/yr, r=5% → ~8.5 years to $946k

(Exact times will vary — run the numbers in the Coast/Fire calculators linked on the site.)

Practical takeaways for late starters

- Be realistic with spending and withdrawal rate: 4–4.5% is safer; if you choose a higher WR, accept the higher chance of running short.
- Prioritize contributions that give you the biggest after-tax boost (employer match, Solo 401k/SEP if self-employed).
- Build optional income streams to reduce sequence-of-returns risk.
- If you're within 5–8 years of your target, increase the bond/cash mix to protect against a major market drop.

- Use the `Coast FIRE Calculator` on this site to model different multipliers and time horizons.
- Read my Solo 401(k) post for acceleration options if you're self-employed.

I'm still experimenting with exact multipliers for late-starters; if you want, tell me your current numbers and I’ll plug them into the calculator and give a short scenario example tailored to you.
