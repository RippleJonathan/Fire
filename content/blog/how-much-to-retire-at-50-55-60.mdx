I'm 40. I discovered FIRE this year. And the first question I asked myself was: **"If I can't retire at 35 like everyone on Reddit, what age is actually realistic—and how much do I need?"**

The answer depends on three critical factors most FIRE content ignores:

1. **How long your money needs to last** (retire at 50 = 40+ years of withdrawals)
2. **Healthcare costs before Medicare** (the $100K+ wildcard nobody talks about)
3. **Reduced compound growth time** (less runway = need more cash upfront)

This post breaks down exactly how much you need to retire at 50, 55, or 60 with real numbers, conservative assumptions, and the healthcare strategies that make it actually work.

## The Core Formula (With Age Adjustments)

The classic FIRE formula is:

```
FIRE Number = Annual Spending × 25 (assumes 4% withdrawal rate)
```

**But this formula assumes:**
- 30-year retirement horizon
- Medicare at 65 (healthcare covered)
- Decades of compound growth to get there

**When you retire earlier, the formula changes.**

### Adjusted Multipliers by Retirement Age

| Retirement Age | Years Until Medicare | Withdrawal Rate | Multiplier | Why It's Different |
|----------------|---------------------|-----------------|------------|-------------------|
| **65+** | 0 (Medicare eligible) | 4.0% | 25× | Standard 4% rule |
| **60-64** | 0-5 years | 4.0-4.2% | 24-25× | Short healthcare bridge |
| **55-59** | 6-10 years | 3.8-4.0% | 25-26× | Longer healthcare bridge |
| **50-54** | 11-15 years | 3.5-3.8% | 26-28× | Very long money runway |
| **45-49** | 16-20 years | 3.3-3.5% | 28-30× | Extreme longevity risk |

**Key insight:** The earlier you retire, the more conservative your withdrawal rate needs to be because:
1. Money needs to last 40-50+ years (vs. 30 years)
2. Healthcare is expensive pre-Medicare
3. Higher sequence-of-returns risk (less time to recover from crashes)

## Retire at 50: The Full Breakdown

### Base Portfolio Calculation

Let's say your annual spending is **$60,000** (a realistic middle-class retirement budget).

**Traditional FIRE math:**
- $60,000 × 25 = $1,500,000

**Age 50 retirement math (conservative):**
- $60,000 × 27 = **$1,620,000**
- Why 27×? You need money to last 40+ years, and you have 15 years before Medicare

### Healthcare Costs (Ages 50-65)

This is where most people underestimate.

**ACA Marketplace (Obamacare) Estimates:**
- Individual: $500-$800/month = $6,000-$9,600/year
- Couple: $1,200-$1,800/month = $14,400-$21,600/year

**If you qualify for subsidies** (Modified Adjusted Gross Income below 400% of Federal Poverty Level):
- 2025 FPL for individual: ~$15,060
- 400% FPL: ~$60,240
- If your MAGI is under $60K, you get premium tax credits
- Subsidies can reduce premiums to $200-$400/month

**How to qualify for subsidies when you have $1.6M:**
- Withdraw mostly from Roth IRA (doesn't count as income)
- Harvest long-term capital gains (0% tax bracket if income is low)
- Use Roth conversion ladder strategically
- Keep taxable income under subsidy thresholds

**My assumption:** Budget $8,000/year for healthcare with subsidies, $15,000/year without.

### Total Amount Needed to Retire at 50

**Scenario A: With ACA Subsidies (MAGI under $60K)**

| Category | Annual Cost | 15-Year Total |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| Base living expenses | $52,000 | — |
| Healthcare (subsidized) | $8,000 | $120,000 |
| **Total Annual** | **$60,000** | — |

**Portfolio needed:**
- Annual spending: $60,000
- Multiplier: 27× (3.7% withdrawal rate)
- **Target: $1,620,000**

**Additional healthcare buffer:** $30,000 (for coverage gaps, deductibles, unexpected costs)

**Grand total: $1,650,000**

---

**Scenario B: Without Subsidies (Higher MAGI)**

| Category | Annual Cost | 15-Year Total |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| Base living expenses | $52,000 | — |
| Healthcare (full cost) | $15,000 | $225,000 |
| **Total Annual** | **$67,000** | — |

**Portfolio needed:**
- Annual spending: $67,000
- Multiplier: 27×
- **Target: $1,809,000**

**Additional healthcare buffer:** $30,000

**Grand total: $1,839,000**

---

### Real Example: What I'd Need to Retire at 50

**My current spending:** $69,000/year (from my FIRE Number post)

**If I retired at 50:**
- Base expenses: $61,000 (cutting discretionary by ~$8K)
- Healthcare (single, with subsidies): $8,000
- **Total: $69,000/year**

**Portfolio calculation:**
- $69,000 × 27 = **$1,863,000**

**Current portfolio:** $285,000  
**Annual savings:** $45,000  
**Expected return:** 6%

**Years to reach $1,863,000:** ~16 years

**Conclusion:** I could retire at age 56, not 50. If I want to retire at 50, I'd need to:
- Increase savings to $60K+/year (cut spending or grow business)
- Accept Lean FIRE ($52K/year spending = $1,404,000 needed = achievable by age 52)
- Plan for Barista FIRE (part-time income to cover healthcare)

## Retire at 55: The Sweet Spot for Late Starters

Age 55 is the "Goldilocks zone" for late-starter FIRE. Here's why:

✅ Only 10 years until Medicare (shorter healthcare bridge)  
✅ 401(k)/IRA penalty-free withdrawals start at 59½ (4.5 years away)  
✅ More time to accumulate (if you're 40 now, you have 15 years vs. 10)  
✅ Social Security at 62 is only 7 years away (early option if needed)  

### Base Portfolio Calculation (Age 55)

**Annual spending: $60,000**

**Age 55 retirement math:**
- $60,000 × 26 = **$1,560,000**
- Why 26×? You need money to last 35-40 years, 10-year healthcare bridge

### Healthcare Costs (Ages 55-65)

**10-year healthcare bridge:**
- With subsidies: $8,000/year × 10 = $80,000
- Without subsidies: $15,000/year × 10 = $150,000

**Total Amount Needed:**

**With subsidies:** $1,560,000 + $30,000 buffer = **$1,590,000**  
**Without subsidies:** $1,560,000 + $70,000 extra = **$1,630,000**

### Why Age 55 Is Easier to Hit

**Starting at 40, targeting 55 (15-year timeline):**

| Current Portfolio | Annual Savings | Expected Return | Portfolio at 55 |
|-------------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| $285,000 | $45,000 | 6% | **$1,590,000** ✅ |
| $200,000 | $40,000 | 6% | $1,380,000 ❌ |
| $150,000 | $50,000 | 6% | $1,480,000 ❌ |
| $300,000 | $35,000 | 6% | $1,470,000 ❌ |

**My scenario:** I'm on track to hit $1,590,000 by age 55 if I maintain current trajectory.

**What makes this achievable:**
- 15 years of compounding (vs. 10 for age 50 target)
- Shorter healthcare bridge (10 years vs. 15)
- Access to 401(k)/IRA at 59½ (less Roth conversion ladder complexity)

## Retire at 60: The Conservative Path

Age 60 is the "safe" early retirement age. Here's the math:

### Base Portfolio Calculation (Age 60)

**Annual spending: $60,000**

**Age 60 retirement math:**
- $60,000 × 25 = **$1,500,000**
- Why 25×? Standard 4% rule works fine (30-year horizon, Medicare in 5 years)

### Healthcare Costs (Ages 60-65)

**5-year healthcare bridge:**
- With subsidies: $8,000/year × 5 = $40,000
- Without subsidies: $15,000/year × 5 = $75,000

**Total Amount Needed:**

**With subsidies:** $1,500,000 + $20,000 buffer = **$1,520,000**  
**Without subsidies:** $1,500,000 + $35,000 extra = **$1,535,000**

### Why Age 60 Is the "Easy" Target

**Starting at 40, targeting 60 (20-year timeline):**

| Current Portfolio | Annual Savings | Expected Return | Portfolio at 60 |
|-------------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| $285,000 | $30,000 | 6% | **$1,820,000** ✅ |
| $200,000 | $25,000 | 6% | $1,530,000 ✅ |
| $150,000 | $35,000 | 6% | $1,650,000 ✅ |
| $100,000 | $40,000 | 6% | $1,660,000 ✅ |

**Key insight:** Even modest savings rates hit the target with 20 years of compounding.

**Advantages of waiting until 60:**
- Only 5 years until Medicare (healthcare is manageable)
- Access to 401(k)/IRA without penalties (you're 60+, over the 59½ threshold)
- Can claim Social Security at 62 if needed (2 years away)
- Mortgage likely paid off by 60 (lower expenses)
- More conservative withdrawal rate (4% is safe for 30-year horizon)

## Healthcare Strategy: The Make-or-Break Factor

Healthcare is the #1 reason people can't retire before 65. Here's how to handle it:

### Strategy 1: ACA with Subsidies (Best for Most)

**How it works:**
1. Keep Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) under 400% FPL (~$60K for single, ~$81K for couple in 2025)
2. Structure withdrawals to minimize taxable income:
   - Roth IRA withdrawals (tax-free, don't count as income)
   - Long-term capital gains in 0% bracket (up to ~$47K for single)
   - Traditional IRA conversions in low brackets (12%)
3. Apply for ACA marketplace coverage with premium tax credits

**Example:**
- You need $60K to live
- Withdraw $20K from Roth (tax-free, $0 MAGI)
- Withdraw $25K from taxable brokerage as LTCG (0% tax, $0 MAGI up to $47K threshold)
- Withdraw $15K from Traditional IRA (taxable, counts as MAGI)
- **Total MAGI: $15K** → qualify for huge ACA subsidies → pay $200-$300/month for health insurance

**Pro:** Saves $6,000-$12,000/year vs. full-cost premiums  
**Con:** Requires careful tax planning and Roth conversion ladder setup

### Strategy 2: Health Sharing Ministries (Risky)

**How it works:**
- Not insurance; members share medical costs
- Cost: $200-$400/month
- Works for healthy people with low medical needs

**Pro:** Cheaper than ACA  
**Con:** Not legally insurance, can deny coverage, risky for serious illness

**My take:** I wouldn't rely on this. If you get sick, you're screwed.

### Strategy 3: Spouse's Employer Insurance (If Applicable)

**How it works:**
- Keep working part-time or have spouse work for health benefits
- "Barista FIRE" approach

**Pro:** Solves healthcare entirely  
**Con:** Not fully retired, dependent on employer

### Strategy 4: Build a Healthcare Sinking Fund

**How it works:**
- Save an extra $100K-$150K specifically for pre-Medicare healthcare
- Buy full-price ACA coverage ($800-$1,500/month)
- Don't worry about subsidy optimization

**Pro:** Simplicity, no MAGI games  
**Con:** Requires significantly more savings upfront

**My plan:** I'm targeting Strategy 1 (ACA with subsidies) and keeping a $30K healthcare emergency fund for gaps.

## The Age Comparison Table (Summary)

Here's everything side-by-side for annual spending of $60,000:

| Retirement Age | Portfolio Needed | Healthcare Cost (15yr/10yr/5yr) | Total Needed | Difficulty |
|----------------|------------------|--------------------------------|--------------|------------|
| **50** | $1,620,000 | $120K (subsidized) | $1,650,000 | Very Hard |
| **55** | $1,560,000 | $80K (subsidized) | $1,590,000 | Hard |
| **60** | $1,500,000 | $40K (subsidized) | $1,520,000 | Moderate |
| **65** | $1,500,000 | $0 (Medicare) | $1,500,000 | Easiest |

**If you can't get ACA subsidies, add $70K-$225K depending on age.**

## Common Mistakes When Planning Retirement Age

### 1. Forgetting Inflation

**Mistake:** "I need $60K/year today, so I need $1,500,000."

**Reality:** If you're retiring in 10-15 years, that $60K/year will be more like $75K-$85K due to inflation.

**Fix:** Multiply current spending by 1.25-1.35 for 10-15 year timelines (assuming 2.5% inflation).

**Example:**
- Current spending: $60,000
- Retire in 15 years: $60,000 × 1.35 = $81,000
- Portfolio needed: $81,000 × 26 = **$2,106,000**

### 2. Underestimating Healthcare

**Mistake:** "I'll just budget $5,000/year for healthcare."

**Reality:** Without subsidies, it's $10,000-$20,000/year depending on age and location.

**Fix:** Budget $8,000-$15,000/year and understand ACA subsidy mechanics.

### 3. Ignoring Sequence-of-Returns Risk

**Mistake:** "I'll just withdraw 4% forever."

**Reality:** If you retire in 2026 and the market crashes 30% in 2027, your portfolio may never recover.

**Fix:** 
- Hold 2-3 years of expenses in cash/bonds at retirement
- Use variable withdrawal strategies (reduce spending in down years)
- Consider a bond tent (shift to bonds before retirement, back to stocks after)

### 4. Not Planning for the "Gap Years"

**Mistake:** "I'll access my 401(k) at 59½."

**Reality:** If you retire at 50, you have 9.5 years to fund before penalty-free access.

**Fix:** Build a Roth conversion ladder (start 5 years before retirement) or keep enough in taxable brokerage to bridge the gap.

### 5. Forgetting About Taxes

**Mistake:** "My portfolio is $1.5M, so I can withdraw $60K/year."

**Reality:** If it's all in a Traditional 401(k), you'll owe taxes on every withdrawal.

**Fix:** 
- Diversify tax treatment (Roth + Traditional + taxable)
- Run withdrawal strategies that minimize tax (use capital gains, Roth contributions, tax-loss harvesting)
- If all Traditional, multiply your target by 1.15-1.25 to account for future taxes

## Real Scenario Planning: Three Profiles

### Profile 1: Age 40, Single, $250K Saved, $50K/Year Savings

**Goal:** Retire at 55

**Calculations:**
- Current: $250K, saving $50K/year at 6% return
- Portfolio at 55: **$1,650,000**
- Annual spending target: $60,000
- Needed: $1,590,000

**Result:** ✅ On track to retire at 55 with small buffer

**Strategy:**
- Continue maxing tax-advantaged accounts (SEP/Solo 401k, Roth IRA, HSA)
- Start Roth conversions at age 50 to build conversion ladder
- Plan for ACA with subsidies (keep MAGI under $60K)

---

### Profile 2: Age 42, Married, $180K Saved, $35K/Year Savings

**Goal:** Retire at 60

**Calculations:**
- Current: $180K, saving $35K/year at 6% return
- Portfolio at 60: **$1,570,000**
- Annual spending target: $70,000 (couple)
- Needed: $1,820,000 (27× for couple with higher healthcare costs)

**Result:** ❌ Short by $250K

**Options:**
1. Increase savings to $45K/year → hit $1,820,000 ✅
2. Reduce retirement spending to $60K/year → need only $1,620,000 ✅
3. Retire at 62 instead of 60 → 2 more years of saving + compounding ✅
4. Plan for Barista FIRE (part-time work age 60-65 for healthcare)

---

### Profile 3: Age 38, Single, $120K Saved, $40K/Year Savings

**Goal:** Retire at 50

**Calculations:**
- Current: $120K, saving $40K/year at 6% return
- Portfolio at 50: **$1,100,000**
- Annual spending target: $55,000
- Needed: $1,485,000 (27× multiplier)

**Result:** ❌ Short by $385K

**Options:**
1. Retire at 55 instead → portfolio grows to $1,650,000 ✅
2. Increase savings to $60K/year → hit $1,485,000 by age 50 ✅
3. Accept Lean FIRE ($40K/year spending = $1,080,000 needed) → retire at 50 ✅
4. Coast FIRE at 48 (stop saving, let it grow to full FIRE by 60)

## My Take: What I'm Actually Planning

I'm 40, self-employed (roofing business, ~$1M revenue, 20% net margin), and I'm **early in my investing journey**.

**My current situation:**
- **Home equity:** ~$215K (bought during COVID at 2.75%, appreciated 50%)
- **Business equity:** ~$200K net income/year, business value unknown
- **Invested portfolio:** Early stage—some crypto and stocks, but haven't hit $100K yet
- **Annual savings potential:** $50-60K/year (via SEP IRA)
- **Target retirement age:** 53-55

**My realistic timeline (starting from near-zero invested):**

| Age | Portfolio (projected) | Status | Plan |
|-----|----------------------|--------|------|
| **40** | ~$0 invested | Starting focused FIRE journey | Max SEP IRA, build aggressively |
| **42** | ~$100K | First major milestone | Compound interest starts kicking in |
| **45** | ~$325K | Early Coast FIRE territory | Reassess: burnt out or keep going? |
| **50** | ~$650K | Below full FIRE | Need Barista FIRE or keep working |
| **53** | ~$900K | Close to FIRE | Possible early retirement |
| **55** | ~$1,200,000 | **Full FIRE** ✅ | Target retirement age |

**My strategy:**

1. **Ages 40-42:** Aggressive saving ($50-60K/year into SEP IRA), hit first $100K invested
2. **Ages 42-50:** Continue maxing SEP, let compound interest accelerate growth
3. **Age 50:** Reassess—am I burned out? If yes, shift to Barista FIRE. If no, push to 55.
4. **Age 53-55:** Target full FIRE with $1.2M+ invested
5. **Build flexibility:** Keep part-time roofing option ($20-30K/year) to extend runway or cover healthcare

**Healthcare plan:**
- Ages 53-59: ACA with subsidies (keep MAGI under $60K via Roth withdrawals + LTCG harvesting)
- Age 60-65: Continue ACA, budget $12-15K/year
- Age 65: Medicare (problem solved)

**Why age 55 is realistic for me:**
- I started investing aggressively late (age 40)
- Business income varies ($50-69K SEP contributions depending on year)
- 15-year runway gives compound interest time to work
- At 55, only 10 years until Medicare (more manageable healthcare bridge)

**Starting late doesn't mean you can't retire early. It means you need to be more strategic, save aggressively, and give yourself a realistic timeline.**

## Action Steps

1. **Pick your target retirement age** (50, 55, 60, or somewhere in between)
2. **Calculate your target number** using the multipliers in this post (26-28× for age 50, 25-26× for 55, 25× for 60)
3. **Add healthcare costs** ($8K-$15K/year × years until Medicare)
4. **Model your timeline** using the FIRE calculator on this site with your current savings and expected contributions
5. **Build a Roth conversion strategy** if retiring before 59½ (start 5 years before retirement)
6. **Research ACA subsidy thresholds** and plan MAGI management to qualify
7. **Set intermediate milestones** (Coast FIRE number, Lean FIRE number) so you have optionality
