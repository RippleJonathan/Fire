I discovered FIRE at 40. Like many late starters, I realized full FIRE by 50 would require extreme sacrificing. But then I found **Barista FIRE**—the strategy that lets you semi-retire years earlier while solving the biggest obstacle to early retirement: healthcare.

Here's everything I wish I'd known about Barista FIRE when I started.

## What Is Barista FIRE?

**Barista FIRE** is a semi-retirement strategy where you work part-time (15-25 hours/week) to cover basic expenses and health insurance, while your investment portfolio grows untouched toward full financial independence.

The name comes from the Starbucks barista job—working enough hours to qualify for health benefits without the soul-crushing grind of full-time corporate work.

**The key formula:**

```
Barista FIRE Number = 15-20× annual expenses (instead of 25×)
Part-time income = Living expenses + healthcare
Portfolio = Grows untouched to full FIRE number
```

### Real Example

**Sarah, age 42:**
- Annual expenses: $45,000
- Full FIRE number (25×): $1,125,000 (15+ years away)
- Barista FIRE number (17×): $765,000 (7 years away)
- Part-time work income needed: $30,000/year
- **Result:** Semi-retires 8 years earlier, works 20 hours/week doing something she enjoys

Instead of grinding in corporate sales until 57, Sarah hits Barista FIRE at 49, gets a part-time bookstore job with health benefits, and lets her $765K grow to $1.5M+ by age 65.

## Why Barista FIRE Is Powerful (Especially After 40)

### 1. Escape the Corporate Grind Years Earlier

Full FIRE at 40 requires either a massive head start or extreme frugality. Barista FIRE is achievable.

**Traditional FIRE timeline:** 15-20 years of aggressive saving  
**Barista FIRE timeline:** 7-12 years of aggressive saving

That's a 40-50% reduction in time grinding at a job you hate.

### 2. Solves the Healthcare Problem

If you're in the US and retiring before 65 (Medicare eligibility), healthcare is the biggest expense and risk.

**Options for early retirees:**
- ACA marketplace: $500-$1,500/month (income-dependent)
- COBRA: $600-$2,000/month (only lasts 18 months)
- Health sharing ministries: $200-$400/month (not real insurance, risky)

**Barista FIRE solution:**
Work 20-30 hours/week at a company that offers health benefits to part-timers.

**Companies known for part-time benefits:**
- Starbucks (20 hours/week minimum)
- Costco (24 hours/week minimum)
- UPS (part-time benefits after 9 months)
- Lowe's (varies by position)
- REI (20 hours/week minimum)
- Whole Foods (20-30 hours/week)
- Trader Joe's (varies by location)

### 3. Lower Portfolio Required = Lower Risk

The 4% rule assumes you need 25× annual expenses. But if part-time work covers your expenses, your portfolio doesn't need to support you for decades—just grow.

**Risk reduction:**
- Smaller portfolio = less sequence of returns risk
- Part-time income cushions market downturns
- Flexibility to adjust work hours if needed
- More time for portfolio to reach full FIRE number

### 4. Psychological Benefits of Work

Retiring at 45 sounds great—until you realize you have zero structure, purpose, or social interaction.

**What I've learned researching FIRE:**
- Many full FIRE retirees get bored and go back to work
- Identity crisis is real ("What do I do all day?")
- Social isolation without work community
- Difficulty explaining to friends/family what you "do"

**Barista FIRE gives you:**
- Structure and routine (but on your terms)
- Social interaction and community
- Sense of purpose and contribution
- Something to do besides "manage my portfolio"
- Easier social explanation ("I work part-time at...")

### 5. Geographic Flexibility

Unlike Coast FIRE (which requires portfolio growth over time), Barista FIRE works anywhere with part-time jobs.

**Examples:**
- Move to low cost-of-living area → easier to cover expenses with part-time work
- Digital nomad → work remote part-time while traveling
- Small town → lower stress, strong community, simple jobs

## The Barista FIRE Formula: How Much Do You Need?

Here's how to calculate your Barista FIRE number:

### Step 1: Calculate Your Annual Expenses

Track spending for 3-6 months, then multiply by 12.

**My expenses (Jonathan, 40, single, Ohio):**
- Rent: $1,400/month ($16,800/year)
- Food: $600/month ($7,200/year)
- Transportation: $400/month ($4,800/year)
- Insurance (non-health): $250/month ($3,000/year)
- Utilities: $200/month ($2,400/year)
- Internet/phone: $100/month ($1,200/year)
- Misc (entertainment, clothing, etc.): $500/month ($6,000/year)

**Total annual expenses:** $41,400

**Healthcare:** NOT included yet (covered by part-time job)

### Step 2: Choose Your Barista FIRE Multiplier

Instead of 25× (traditional FIRE), use **15-20×** depending on:
- How long until traditional retirement age
- Risk tolerance
- Stability of part-time work

**Conservative (20×):** More cushion, higher safety  
**Moderate (17×):** Balanced approach  
**Aggressive (15×):** Assumes consistent part-time income

**My choice:** 17× (moderate)

**My Barista FIRE number:** $41,400 × 17 = **$703,800**

### Step 3: Calculate Part-Time Income Needed

Your part-time work needs to cover living expenses (since portfolio isn't being withdrawn).

**My target:** $41,400/year from part-time work

**How much per hour?**
- 20 hours/week × 50 weeks = 1,000 hours/year
- $41,400 ÷ 1,000 hours = **$41.40/hour** (not happening at Starbucks)

OR

- 30 hours/week × 50 weeks = 1,500 hours/year
- $41,400 ÷ 1,500 hours = **$27.60/hour** (realistic for skilled work)

**My plan:** 
- Part-time roofing consultations: 15 hours/week at $50/hour = $37,500/year
- Small freelance projects: $5,000/year
- Total: $42,500/year (covers expenses + small buffer)

### Step 4: Timeline to Barista FIRE

**Current situation (Jonathan, real numbers):**
- Age: 40
- Current investments: $75,000
- Barista FIRE number: $703,800
- Gap: $628,800
- Annual savings capacity: $50,000

**Timeline:** $628,800 ÷ $50,000 = **12.6 years** (age 52-53)

BUT compound interest accelerates this:

Using 7% average returns:
- Years to Barista FIRE: **~9 years** (age 49)
- Full FIRE at that savings rate: 15+ years (age 55+)

**I can semi-retire 6 years earlier with Barista FIRE.**

## Barista FIRE Strategies: How to Make It Work

### Strategy 1: Find a Part-Time Job with Benefits

This is the cornerstone of Barista FIRE.

**Target characteristics:**
- 20-30 hours/week
- Offers health insurance to part-timers
- Minimal stress
- Ideally: something you don't hate

**Job ideas by skill level:**

**Low barrier to entry:**
- Starbucks barista ($15-18/hour + benefits)
- Costco stocker ($18-25/hour + benefits)
- REI retail associate ($15-20/hour + benefits)
- Library assistant ($15-20/hour, often benefits)
- School bus driver (part-time, benefits, summers off)

**Mid-level skills:**
- Bookkeeper for small businesses ($25-35/hour)
- Administrative assistant ($18-25/hour)
- Freelance writer/editor ($30-60/hour, buy own insurance)
- Part-time property manager ($20-30/hour)
- Substitute teacher ($20-30/hour in many states)

**High-level skills:**
- Consulting in your former field (your rate, your hours)
- Part-time contract work (software dev, design, etc.)
- Adjunct professor ($3,000-6,000 per course)
- Part-time healthcare work (nursing, physical therapy)

**My plan (roofing business owner):**
I'll keep my business but reduce to consultations and small projects only. 15 hours/week, cherry-pick the best clients, charge premium rates. Estimated $40K/year with minimal stress.

### Strategy 2: Geographic Arbitrage

Move somewhere with lower cost of living = easier to cover expenses with part-time work.

**Example:**

**Before (San Francisco):**
- Rent: $3,000/month
- Expenses: $6,000/month ($72,000/year)
- Part-time income needed: $72,000 (48 hours/week at $30/hour)

**After (Austin, Texas):**
- Rent: $1,400/month
- Expenses: $3,200/month ($38,400/year)
- Part-time income needed: $38,400 (25 hours/week at $30/hour)

Moving cuts work hours needed by nearly 50%.

**Best Barista FIRE locations:**
- Low cost-of-living
- Strong job market (even part-time)
- No state income tax (bonus)
- Good quality of life

**Top cities for Barista FIRE:**
1. Austin, TX (no state tax, jobs, culture)
2. Raleigh, NC (low cost, jobs, great weather)
3. Nashville, TN (no state tax, growing economy)
4. Tampa, FL (no state tax, warm, affordable)
5. Boise, ID (low cost, outdoors, growing)
6. Columbus, OH (cheap, stable, Midwest)
7. Chattanooga, TN (cheap, fiber internet, outdoors)

### Strategy 3: Build Multiple Income Streams

Don't rely on one part-time job. Diversify.

**My diversified Barista FIRE income plan:**
- Primary: Part-time roofing consultations ($30K/year)
- Secondary: Freelance writing/blogging ($8K/year)
- Tertiary: Small rental income or dividends ($5K/year)

**Total:** $43K/year from 3 sources = resilient to any one source failing

### Strategy 4: Side Hustle to Part-Time Business

Turn your side hustle into your Barista FIRE income.

**Examples:**
- Etsy shop → work 20 hours/week managing orders
- YouTube channel → monetize, work on content part-time
- Dog walking service → 15-20 dogs/week
- Photography → weekend weddings + editing
- Rental property → part-time landlord/manager

**Advantage:** You're building this BEFORE Barista FIRE, so it's proven and stable when you need it.

### Strategy 5: Seasonal Work

Work intensely for 6-9 months, take the rest of the year off.

**Examples:**
- Tax preparer (January-April)
- Ski resort worker (November-March)
- Summer camp counselor (June-August)
- Amazon warehouse (October-December)
- Wildland firefighter (May-September)

**How it works:**
- Earn $40-50K in 6-9 months
- Live frugally during work season
- Enjoy 3-6 months fully off
- Portfolio grows untouched

## Barista FIRE vs Other FIRE Variants

Let me break down how Barista FIRE compares:

| Strategy | Portfolio Size | Work Required | Healthcare | Timeline | Best For |
|----------|----------------|---------------|------------|----------|----------|
| **Traditional FIRE** | 25-30× expenses | None | ACA or early Medicare | 15-20 years | High earners, extreme savers |
| **Barista FIRE** | 15-20× expenses | Part-time (20-30 hrs/wk) | Employer-provided | 7-12 years | Anyone wanting earlier freedom |
| **Coast FIRE** | 10-15× expenses | Full-time → part-time | ACA or employer | 5-10 years | Young savers with time |
| **Lean FIRE** | 20-25× expenses | None | ACA | 10-15 years | Frugal minimalists |
| **Fat FIRE** | 30-40× expenses | None | Premium ACA | 20-30 years | High earners wanting luxury |

**When to choose Barista FIRE:**
- ✅ You're burned out and need relief ASAP
- ✅ Healthcare is a major concern (pre-Medicare age)
- ✅ You actually like parts of work (just not 50 hours/week)
- ✅ You want structure and purpose
- ✅ You're starting FIRE late (35-45)

**When NOT to choose Barista FIRE:**
- ❌ You absolutely hate all work (go for Lean FIRE)
- ❌ You're young with 20+ years to retirement (Coast FIRE is better)
- ❌ You have health issues that prevent part-time work
- ❌ You have a pension or guaranteed income source

## The Healthcare Deep Dive

This deserves its own section because it's THE reason most people choose Barista FIRE.

### The Problem with ACA (Affordable Care Act)

If you retire before 65, your options are:
1. **ACA marketplace insurance**
2. **COBRA (temporary)**
3. **Spouse's employer plan**
4. **Health sharing ministries (risky)**

**ACA costs by income:**

| Annual Income | Premium (40-year-old) | With Subsidies |
|---------------|----------------------|----------------|
| $20,000 | $400-600/month | $50-150/month |
| $40,000 | $500-700/month | $200-400/month |
| $60,000 | $600-800/month | $400-600/month |
| $80,000+ | $700-1,200/month | Minimal subsidy |

**The catch:**
- ACA subsidies are income-based
- Capital gains count as income
- Roth conversions count as income
- If you're living on portfolio withdrawals, you might have "high income" on paper

**Example:**
- You withdraw $50K from taxable brokerage
- $40K is capital gains (counts as income)
- Now you're in a higher ACA bracket
- Premium: $600/month instead of $200/month
- That's $4,800/year extra

### The Barista FIRE Solution

Work 20-30 hours/week for employer-provided health insurance.

**What you get:**
- Health insurance (medical, dental, vision)
- Employer pays 50-80% of premium
- Your cost: $50-200/month (vs $400-800 on ACA)
- Predictable, stable coverage

**Savings: $300-600/month ($3,600-7,200/year)**

**Here's the math:**

Traditional FIRE with ACA:
- Portfolio needed: $1,125,000 (25× $45K expenses)
- Healthcare: $7,200/year (added expense)
- Adjusted expenses: $52,200/year
- Adjusted portfolio: $1,305,000

**You just added $180,000 to your FIRE number for healthcare.**

Barista FIRE with employer healthcare:
- Portfolio needed: $765,000 (17× $45K expenses)
- Healthcare: Covered by employer ($100/month out of pocket)
- Part-time income: Covers all living expenses + healthcare

**You need $540,000 LESS with Barista FIRE.**

At a $50K annual savings rate:
- Traditional FIRE: 15+ years
- Barista FIRE: 9-10 years

**You escape the corporate grind 5-6 years earlier.**

## Real Barista FIRE Examples

### Example 1: The Teacher Turned Bookstore Worker

**Lisa, age 44:**
- Former high school teacher (burned out after 20 years)
- Saved aggressively: $650,000 invested
- Full FIRE number: $1,200,000 (too far away)
- Barista FIRE number: $650,000 ✅

**Her Barista FIRE plan:**
- Quit teaching
- Got part-time job at indie bookstore: 25 hours/week, $18/hour
- Annual income: $23,400
- Expenses: $35,000
- Gap: $11,600 (covered by small freelance tutoring)
- Health insurance: Through bookstore

**Result:** Works 25 hours/week doing something she loves, has health benefits, lets $650K grow to full FIRE over 15 years. Zero stress. Total freedom.

### Example 2: The Software Engineer Who Coaches

**Mark, age 38:**
- Burned out from startup life
- Saved: $800,000
- Full FIRE number: $1,500,000 (8+ years away)
- Barista FIRE number: $800,000 ✅

**His Barista FIRE plan:**
- Quit software job
- Became part-time youth soccer coach + referee
- Income: $30,000/year (20 hours/week)
- Expenses: $42,000/year
- Gap: $12,000 (covers with occasional freelance coding projects)
- Health insurance: Through city rec department

**Result:** Spends 20 hours/week coaching kids, stays active, has purpose, zero commute stress. Portfolio grows to $2M+ by age 60.

### Example 3: The Couple Who Went Rural

**Dan & Amy, ages 47 & 45:**
- Saved: $900,000
- Full FIRE number: $1,800,000 (15+ years away in expensive city)
- Barista FIRE number: $750,000 ✅ (with geographic arbitrage)

**Their Barista FIRE plan:**
- Sold house in Denver, moved to small town Montana
- Dan works part-time at Costco: 24 hours/week, $24/hour
- Amy substitute teaches: 15 hours/week average, $180/day
- Combined income: $45,000/year
- Expenses: $40,000/year (way lower in Montana)
- Health insurance: Through Costco

**Result:** Escaped city stress, live near mountains, work part-time, have community. Portfolio grows while they enjoy life in their 40s instead of grinding to 60.

## Common Barista FIRE Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

### Mistake 1: Underestimating Expenses

You think you need $40K/year, but you actually spend $55K.

**Solution:**
- Track expenses for 12 months BEFORE Barista FIRE
- Add 10-15% buffer for unexpected costs
- Include healthcare out-of-pocket costs (deductibles, copays)
- Don't forget annual expenses (car insurance, property tax)

### Mistake 2: Overestimating Part-Time Income

That $25/hour part-time job might be $18/hour in reality.

**Solution:**
- Research actual wages in your area
- Have job lined up BEFORE quitting
- Build cushion in portfolio for income shortfall
- Test part-time work on weekends before committing

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Taxes

Part-time income is taxed. Don't forget.

**Example:**
- Part-time income: $35,000
- Federal tax (12% bracket): ~$2,500
- State tax (varies): ~$1,400
- FICA (7.65%): ~$2,700
- **Total taxes:** ~$6,600

**Your $35,000 income is really $28,400 after taxes.**

**Solution:**
- Calculate net income (after taxes)
- Use tax-advantaged accounts if possible
- Consider self-employment for tax deductions

### Mistake 4: Choosing a Job You Hate

Barista FIRE with a soul-sucking job defeats the purpose.

**Solution:**
- Find work you tolerate (or better, enjoy)
- Prioritize low-stress over slightly higher pay
- Remember: you're financially independent, work is optional
- If job sucks after 6 months, quit and find another

### Mistake 5: Touching the Portfolio

"Just $10K for a new car won't hurt..."

**The problem:**
- Every withdrawal delays full FIRE
- Compound interest works in reverse
- $10K withdrawal = $40K+ lost growth over 20 years

**Solution:**
- Treat portfolio as untouchable
- Build emergency fund separate from FIRE portfolio (3-6 months expenses)
- Cover ALL expenses from part-time income
- Only exception: true emergency (medical, job loss)

### Mistake 6: No Backup Plan

Your part-time job disappears. Now what?

**Solution:**
- Have 6-12 months expenses in cash
- Build multiple income streams (not just one job)
- Keep skills sharp for returning to full-time work if needed
- Don't burn bridges with former employers

## My Barista FIRE Plan (What I'm Actually Doing)

Here's my honest plan as a 40-year-old roofing business owner who discovered FIRE late:

**Current status (2025):**
- Age: 40
- Invested: ~$75,000
- Income: $85,000/year (business owner)
- Expenses: $41,400/year
- Savings rate: ~50% ($42,000/year)

**My Barista FIRE number:** $703,800 (17× expenses)

**Timeline:**
- Continue aggressive saving: 2025-2034 (age 50)
- Hit Barista FIRE number: 2033-2034 (age 48-49)
- Transition to Barista FIRE mode

**My Barista FIRE work:**
- Reduce roofing to consultations only: 15 hours/week
- Small roofing projects (1-2 per month): 10 hours/week
- Fire Driven Media (this site) monetization: 5 hours/week
- Total work: 30 hours/week
- Target income: $45,000/year

**Healthcare plan:**
- Option 1: Keep one employee, maintain business group health plan
- Option 2: Part-time work with benefits (fallback if business slows)
- Option 3: ACA with income optimization (Roth conversions)

**Why I like this plan:**

1. **Achievable:** 8-9 years vs 15+ for full FIRE
2. **Flexible:** I control the work (business owner)
3. **Identity preservation:** I'm still "a roofer" socially
4. **Purpose:** Helping people, staying active
5. **Optionality:** If I hit full FIRE earlier, great. If not, I'm already living well.

**What I'll do differently than traditional FIRE:**
- I won't obsess over hitting exact numbers
- I'll enjoy the journey (not just sacrifice for endpoint)
- I'll build skills/relationships that make Barista FIRE enjoyable
- I'll test part-time work while still full-time (side projects now)

## How to Transition to Barista FIRE

You've hit your Barista FIRE number. Now what?

### Phase 1: Prepare (6-12 months before)

**Financial:**
- Verify your FIRE number is accurate
- Build 12-month emergency fund (in addition to portfolio)
- Max out tax-advantaged accounts one last time
- Rebalance portfolio for stability (add bonds)

**Career:**
- Research part-time jobs in your area
- Update resume for part-time positions
- Network for part-time opportunities
- Apply and interview (have job offer before quitting)

**Psychological:**
- Tell spouse/family the plan
- Set expectations (this isn't full retirement)
- Plan your daily routine (what will you DO with time?)
- Join communities (avoid isolation)

### Phase 2: Quit Full-Time Work

**Options:**

1. **Immediate quit** (if you have job lined up)
2. **Negotiate part-time** (ask current employer for reduced hours)
3. **Sabbatical first** (take 3-6 months off, then start part-time)

**What I'd do:** Take 3 months fully off to decompress, then start part-time work fresh.

### Phase 3: Start Barista FIRE Life

**First 90 days:**
- Start part-time work
- Track all expenses obsessively
- Verify income covers expenses
- Adjust if needed (more hours or lower expenses)

**First year:**
- Don't touch portfolio (prove you can live on part-time income)
- Optimize part-time work (find what you enjoy)
- Build routine and structure
- Check portfolio quarterly (not daily)

**Years 2-5:**
- Relax and enjoy
- Let portfolio compound
- Adjust work as needed
- Reevaluate full FIRE timeline

### Phase 4: Transition to Full FIRE

Eventually, your portfolio grows to full FIRE number.

**When to transition:**
- Portfolio hits 25-30× expenses
- You're tired of working (even part-time)
- Part-time work becomes unreliable
- You hit traditional retirement age

**How to transition:**
- Give notice at part-time job (maintain relationships)
- Switch to 4% portfolio withdrawals
- Set up Roth conversion ladder
- Optimize taxes in early retirement

## The Tax Strategy for Barista FIRE

Barista FIRE has unique tax optimization opportunities.

### During Barista FIRE (Part-Time Work Phase)

**Goal:** Keep income low to maximize future Roth conversions

**Strategy:**
1. **Live on part-time W-2 income** ($30-45K/year)
2. **Don't withdraw from portfolio** (let it grow)
3. **Max tax-advantaged accounts if possible** (small 401k contributions from part-time work)
4. **Harvest capital gains at 0% rate** (if in 12% bracket)

**Tax bracket optimization:**

If your part-time income is $35,000:
- Standard deduction: $14,600 (2025)
- Taxable income: $20,400
- Tax bracket: 10-12%
- **Room for 0% capital gains:** Up to ~$47,000 (under $94,600 threshold)

**What this means:**
You can harvest up to $26,600 in long-term capital gains at 0% tax rate annually while working part-time.

### Transition to Full FIRE (Stop Working Phase)

**Goal:** Access retirement accounts penalty-free, minimize taxes

**Roth conversion ladder strategy:**

**Years 1-5 of full FIRE:**
1. Live on taxable brokerage withdrawals
2. Convert Traditional IRA/401k to Roth ($50K/year)
3. Pay taxes on conversions at low rate (12% bracket)
4. After 5 years, converted money is accessible penalty-free

**Example:**

Year 1 (age 55):
- Withdraw $45K from taxable account (living expenses)
- Convert $50K Traditional → Roth (pay ~$6K tax)
- Total income: $95K
- Tax owed: ~$6,000

Year 6 (age 60):
- Withdraw $45K from ROTH (year 1 conversion, now seasoned)
- Convert another $50K Traditional → Roth
- Repeat until Traditional accounts empty

**Result:** Access all retirement money by 60-65, pay minimal tax, ready for Medicare at 65.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I do Barista FIRE with a family?

Yes, but it's harder. You need:
- Higher expenses (bigger portfolio or more part-time income)
- Stable healthcare (critical with kids)
- Spousal buy-in (both partners on board)
- Bigger emergency fund (kids = unexpected costs)

**Example:** Family of 4, $70K/year expenses
- Barista FIRE number: $70K × 17 = $1,190,000
- Part-time income needed: $70K/year
- **Strategy:** Both spouses work part-time (20 hours each)

### What if I can't find part-time work with benefits?

**Options:**
1. Buy ACA insurance (optimize income for subsidies)
2. Spouse's employer plan (if applicable)
3. Health sharing ministry (risky)
4. Move to country with universal healthcare (Costa Rica, Portugal, etc.)
5. Increase Barista FIRE number to cover ACA costs

### Is Barista FIRE worth it if I like my job?

If you love your full-time job, maybe not. But consider:
- Would you like it at 30 hours/week instead of 50?
- Would you like it with total financial freedom?
- What if you could do ONLY the parts you enjoy?

**Many people "negotiate Barista FIRE" with current employer:**
- Reduce to 30 hours/week
- Go part-time/contract
- Keep benefits, lower stress

### What's the minimum portfolio for Barista FIRE?

**Rule of thumb:** 15× annual expenses (absolute minimum)

**Examples:**
- $30K/year expenses = $450K minimum
- $40K/year expenses = $600K minimum
- $50K/year expenses = $750K minimum

**Lower than this:** You're relying too heavily on part-time income (that's just working, not FIRE)

### Can I retire internationally with Barista FIRE?

Absolutely. In fact, it's easier.

**Examples:**
- Portugal: Remote part-time work + low cost living
- Mexico: Digital nomad visa + part-time income
- Thailand: Teach English part-time + portfolio growth
- Costa Rica: Pura vida lifestyle + remote work

**Healthcare:** Often cheaper abroad (Portugal: €100/month for private insurance)

### What if the market crashes right after I start Barista FIRE?

This is a risk. Here's how to mitigate:

**Before Barista FIRE:**
- Build extra cash cushion (12-18 months expenses)
- Add bonds to portfolio (20-30% allocation)
- Have buffer in portfolio (aim for 20× expenses instead of 15×)

**During crash:**
- Keep working part-time (don't quit)
- Consider adding hours temporarily
- Don't sell stocks at bottom
- Wait for recovery (historically 2-5 years)

**Remember:** You're not withdrawing from portfolio, so sequence of returns risk is lower than traditional FIRE.

## Tools and Resources

### Calculate Your Barista FIRE Number

**Formula:**
```
Barista FIRE Number = Annual Expenses × 15 to 20
```

**Part-time income needed:**
```
Part-Time Income = Annual Expenses + Healthcare Costs
```

**Years to Barista FIRE:**
```
Years = (Goal - Current Portfolio) ÷ (Annual Savings + Expected Returns)
```

Use our [Coast FIRE Calculator](/calculators/coast-fire) to run your numbers—the math is similar.

## Is Barista FIRE Right for You?

**Consider Barista FIRE if:**
- ✅ You're burned out but not quite at full FIRE
- ✅ Healthcare is a major concern (US, pre-65)
- ✅ You want structure and purpose in semi-retirement
- ✅ You're okay working 20-30 hours/week long-term
- ✅ You want financial freedom ASAP (not willing to wait 15+ years)
- ✅ You're starting FIRE late (35-45 years old)

**Skip Barista FIRE if:**
- ❌ You absolutely hate working (any amount)
- ❌ You're young with 20+ years to retirement (Coast FIRE is better)
- ❌ You have passive income that covers expenses
- ❌ You have a pension or guaranteed retirement income
- ❌ You're within 5 years of full FIRE anyway

## My Take: Why I'm Planning Barista FIRE

I discovered FIRE at 40. Full FIRE by 55 is possible, but it requires 15 years of intense focus. Barista FIRE by 48-50? That's only 8-10 years.

Here's what I've realized:

**I don't want to fully retire.** I like working—I just hate working 50-60 hours/week with no control. I like solving problems, helping customers, building things. I just want to do it on my terms, 20-30 hours/week, with zero financial pressure.

**Barista FIRE gives me that.** I keep doing roofing consultations because I WANT to, not because I HAVE to. I work 15-20 hours/week, make $40-50K, cover all my expenses, and let my $700K+ portfolio grow to $1.5M+ over 15 years.

**The healthcare piece is critical.** I'm self-employed now, paying $450/month for mediocre ACA insurance. If I can work part-time for a company with benefits, I save $400/month ($4,800/year) and get better coverage. That alone is worth it.

**Psychologically, I need structure.** I've worked since I was 16. The idea of waking up at 40-50 with nothing to do sounds awful. Part-time work gives me purpose, routine, and social interaction without the soul-crushing grind.

**Barista FIRE is my target.** If I hit full FIRE earlier, great. But I'm not counting on it. I'm building a life where I work 20-30 hours/week doing things I enjoy, have health insurance, and watch my portfolio grow.

**That sounds like freedom to me.**
