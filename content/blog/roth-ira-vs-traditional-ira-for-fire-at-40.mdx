When you're 40 and thinking about FIRE, the Roth vs Traditional decision matters more than it did in your 20s. Taxes are one variable you can control; here's a straightforward way to think about it.

My short rule of thumb:
- If you expect your retirement tax rate to be *higher* than today → prefer Roth.
- If you expect it to be *lower* → Traditional may be better.

But the real decision has three parts: current tax benefit, future tax certainty, and flexibility.

1) Current tax benefit

- Traditional IRA (or pre-tax Solo 401k/SEP): lowers taxable income today. Useful if you're in a high bracket and need room for deductions or reinvesting in your business.
- Roth IRA: no deduction today, but tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals later (assuming rules met).

2) Future tax certainty

At 40, you can reasonably expect higher taxable income in retirement if you withdraw from non-qualified accounts and have pensions/other income — or lower taxes if you downshift lifestyle. Think about likely Social Security, part-time income, and how your business will be run.

3) Flexibility & rules that matter for late starters

- Roth contributions (not conversions) can be withdrawn penalty-free — useful as a quasi emergency buffer.
- Traditional accounts require RMDs later (though Roth 401ks do too, but Roth IRAs don't). If you plan to leave money to heirs, Roth IRAs are attractive.

Tax examples (simplified)

- Example 1 — You’re in 24% bracket today, expect 20% in retirement: Traditional likely wins for pre-tax benefit.
- Example 2 — You’re in 22% today but expect a similar or higher rate later: Roth looks better.

Conversion strategy for late starters

- Backdoor Roth: useful if you’re over income limits.
- Partial conversions: do conversions in lower-income years (e.g., slow business years or early retirement years when income drops) to minimize tax pains.

Practical steps I used and recommend

- Max employer match first. Then prioritize the account that fixes your biggest pain point (tax bill this year vs future tax certainty).
- If you plan to retire early but expect part-time income, model tax brackets for your likely retirement years. Small changes in assumed brackets change the math.
- Use partial Roth conversions in years when your self-employment income is lower.

What I do (and why)

I mix accounts: max pre-tax in heavy-income years (SEP/Solo contributions) and use Roth conversions selectively in quieter years. It gives me flexibility and tax diversification — and that matters when you start later because you may need to shift strategies quickly.

If you want, I can show a simple worksheet where you enter current bracket, expected retirement bracket, and it recommends contribution priority. Want me to add that as a calculator on the site?
