Coast FIRE is one of my favorite mental models because it gives people options: you can stop aggressively saving now and let compound growth carry you to full FIRE later.

Short definition: your `Coast FIRE number` is the amount you need invested today such that, with expected returns, it grows to your target portfolio by traditional retirement age without additional contributions.

Why it's useful for late starters

- If you're starting late but already have a decent nest egg, Coast FIRE shows whether you can maintain current contributions and relax later — or if you need to accelerate.

How to calculate it

You need three inputs:
- Target portfolio at retirement (your FIRE number)
- Expected annual return (nominal or real, be explicit)
- Years until your planned retirement age (e.g., from 40 to 65 = 25 years)

Formula rearranged from FV:
Present Value required = Target / (1 + r)^n

Example: target $1,000,000, r=6%, n=25 → required today = $1,000,000 / (1.06)^25 ≈ $232,000

Interpretation

- If you already have ≥ $232k invested, you can "coast" — stop new contributions and still reach $1M at 6% annual return by 65.
- If you have less, calculate how much you'd need to add annually to reach the target if you want to stop contributions earlier.

Practical checklist before you coast

- Confirm assumptions: expected return, inflation, and time horizon.
- Adjust for expected larger expenses (kids, healthcare, housing) — increase target if needed.
- Consider sequence-of-returns risk as you approach retirement.

Lead-in: why I built a calculator

The site’s Coast FIRE calculator lets you plug numbers and see charts: years to target, required present value, and required annual contribution to stop in X years. It also offers a conservative scenario (4% real return) so you can see the downside.

Action items

- Try the Coast FIRE calculator and adjust the return rate to 4–8%.
- If you’re within 10–15 years of retirement, consider shifting some allocation to bonds to protect gains.

If you want, I can convert this into a short video walkthrough showing the calculator inputs and outputs — say yes and I’ll schedule it for next week.
