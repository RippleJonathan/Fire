Coast FIRE changed how I think about my FIRE timeline.

When I discovered it at 40, I realized I didn't have to choose between "grind until $1.5M" or "give up on FIRE entirely." There was a middle path: get to a specific number, then stop aggressive saving and let compound growth carry me to full FIRE.

It's the flexibility strategy that makes late-starting FIRE actually sustainable.

This post explains exactly what Coast FIRE is, how to calculate your Coast FIRE number, when it makes sense, and when you should keep accelerating instead.

## What Is Coast FIRE?

**Coast FIRE** is the point where you have enough invested that — with no additional contributions — your portfolio will grow to your full FIRE number by traditional retirement age (typically 65-67).

Once you hit your Coast FIRE number, you can:
- Stop aggressive saving
- Take a lower-paying but more enjoyable job
- Work part-time to cover current expenses
- Reduce stress and burnout
- Let your investments "coast" to full FIRE while you live your life

**The key difference:**

- **Traditional FIRE:** Save aggressively until you have 25× annual expenses, then retire completely
- **Coast FIRE:** Save aggressively until you have enough for compound growth to do the rest, then ease off the gas
- **Barista FIRE:** Work part-time to cover expenses while your portfolio grows
- **Lean FIRE:** Retire early with a smaller portfolio and reduced lifestyle

Coast FIRE sits between "still grinding" and "fully retired." It's the off-ramp for people who want freedom *now* without waiting for the full FIRE number.

## The Coast FIRE Formula

The formula is simple. You're solving for the **Present Value** needed today so that it grows to your target portfolio by retirement age.

### Basic Formula:
```
Coast FIRE Number = Target Portfolio ÷ (1 + r)^n
```

Where:
- **Target Portfolio** = Your full FIRE number (annual expenses × 25, or whatever multiplier you use)
- **r** = Expected annual return (e.g., 0.06 for 6%)
- **n** = Number of years until traditional retirement age (e.g., 25 years if you're 40 and planning for 65)

### Example:

Let's say:
- Your FIRE number is **$1,500,000** (to support $60,000/year at 4% withdrawal rate)
- You're **40 years old**, planning for retirement at **65** (n = 25 years)
- Expected return: **6% annually**

**Coast FIRE Number = $1,500,000 ÷ (1.06)^25**

Breaking it down:
- (1.06)^25 = 4.2919
- $1,500,000 ÷ 4.2919 = **$349,530**

**Interpretation:** If you have $349,530 invested today and earn 6% annually with no additional contributions, it will grow to $1,500,000 in 25 years.

That's your Coast FIRE number.

## Real-World Scenarios: What Your Coast Number Might Be

Let me show you scenarios for different ages, FIRE numbers, and assumptions.

### Scenario 1: Age 35, Targeting $1.2M by 65

**Assumptions:**
- Current age: 35
- Retirement age: 65
- Years to grow: 30
- Target FIRE number: $1,200,000
- Expected return: 6%

**Coast FIRE Number = $1,200,000 ÷ (1.06)^30**
- (1.06)^30 = 5.7435
- **Coast Number = $208,900**

**What this means:** If you're 35 and have $209K invested, you can stop contributing and still hit $1.2M by 65 at 6% returns.

### Scenario 2: Age 40, Targeting $1.5M by 65 (My Scenario)

**Assumptions:**
- Current age: 40
- Retirement age: 65
- Years to grow: 25
- Target FIRE number: $1,500,000
- Expected return: 6%

**Coast FIRE Number = $1,500,000 ÷ (1.06)^25**
- **Coast Number = $349,530**

**Current status:** I have $285K. I need another $65K to hit Coast FIRE.

**At my current savings rate ($45K/year):** I'll hit Coast FIRE in ~1.5 years (age 41-42).

### Scenario 3: Age 45, Targeting $2M by 67

**Assumptions:**
- Current age: 45
- Retirement age: 67
- Years to grow: 22
- Target FIRE number: $2,000,000
- Expected return: 6%

**Coast FIRE Number = $2,000,000 ÷ (1.06)^22**
- (1.06)^22 = 3.6035
- **Coast Number = $554,980**

**What this means:** If you're 45 with $555K invested, you can coast to $2M by 67.

### Scenario 4: Age 50, Targeting $1M by 65 (Conservative)

**Assumptions:**
- Current age: 50
- Retirement age: 65
- Years to grow: 15
- Target FIRE number: $1,000,000
- Expected return: 5% (more conservative)

**Coast FIRE Number = $1,000,000 ÷ (1.05)^15**
- (1.05)^15 = 2.0789
- **Coast Number = $481,020**

**What this means:** You need nearly half your FIRE number already invested because you have less time for compounding.

## The Impact of Return Assumptions (This Is Critical)

The expected return rate **massively** impacts your Coast FIRE number. Let's see what happens if you use different return assumptions.

### Coast Number Sensitivity Analysis (Age 40, $1.5M target, retire at 65)

| Expected Return | Coast FIRE Number | Difference from 6% |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **4% (conservative)** | $562,500 | +$213K |
| **5%** | $443,580 | +$94K |
| **6% (realistic)** | $349,530 | Baseline |
| **7%** | $276,780 | -$73K |
| **8% (optimistic)** | $219,960 | -$130K |

**Key insight:** A 2% difference in expected return changes your Coast number by $100K+.

**My approach:** I calculate Coast FIRE using three scenarios:

1. **Conservative (4-5% real return):** This is my "worst case" number. If I hit this, I'm confident even in a bad market.
2. **Realistic (6% real return):** This is my planning number. Historically reasonable for 70/30 or 80/20 portfolio.
3. **Optimistic (7-8% real return):** Nice if it happens, but I don't count on it.

I aim for the **conservative** number and track the **realistic** number.

## When Coast FIRE Makes Sense (And When It Doesn't)

### Coast FIRE Is Great If:

✅ **You're burned out and need a break from aggressive saving**  
If you're grinding 60-hour weeks to save $50K/year and it's destroying your mental health, hitting Coast FIRE gives you permission to downshift.

✅ **You want to pursue a lower-paying passion**  
Maybe you want to teach, start a creative business, or work in a nonprofit. Coast FIRE lets you do that without sacrificing your retirement.

✅ **You're starting late (35-45) and need milestones**  
The full FIRE number can feel impossibly far away. Coast FIRE is an achievable intermediate goal that proves you're on track.

✅ **You have 15-25 years until traditional retirement age**  
This is the sweet spot for Coast FIRE. Enough time for compounding, but not so long that the number is trivially small.

✅ **You value flexibility and optionality**  
Coast FIRE is a backstop. You can always keep contributing and accelerate to full FIRE. But knowing you *could* coast reduces stress.

### Coast FIRE Might Not Be Right If:

❌ **You want to retire in the next 5-10 years**  
If you're close to full FIRE, just push through. Coast FIRE is for people with longer timelines.

❌ **You're under 35 with high income**  
If you're 28 making $150K, your Coast number is probably $80K. You'll hit that accidentally. Just keep maxing retirement accounts and aim for full FIRE.

❌ **You don't trust your discipline to avoid lifestyle creep**  
Coast FIRE requires discipline not to increase spending once you stop aggressive saving. If you'll just inflate your lifestyle, it won't work.

❌ **You have significant debt**  
Pay off high-interest debt first. Coast FIRE assumes you're investing, not paying 6-20% interest on credit cards or loans.

❌ **You hate your job and need to escape NOW**  
Coast FIRE still requires working (just less stressfully). If you need to quit ASAP, aim for Barista FIRE or Lean FIRE instead.

## My Coast FIRE Plan (What I'm Actually Doing)

**Current numbers (age 40):**
- Portfolio: $285,000
- Annual savings: $45,000
- FIRE number: $1,587,000 (to support $69K/year at 4.3% withdrawal)
- Coast FIRE number (6% return, retire at 65): $370,000

**Timeline:**
- **2026 (age 41):** Hit Coast FIRE number ($370K)
- **2028 (age 43):** Hit "Aggressive Coast" number ($500K for 5% return assumption)
- **2030 (age 45):** Decide whether to downshift or push to full FIRE

**Decision point at age 45:**

By then, I'll have been grinding for 5 more years. I'll assess:

1. **Am I burned out?** If yes, Coast FIRE activated. Reduce to part-time roofing ($20K/year to cover expenses).
2. **Am I still energized?** If yes, keep saving aggressively and aim for full FIRE by 50-52.
3. **Did something change?** (Health, family, new opportunity) Adjust accordingly.

**Why I like this plan:**

It gives me optionality. I'm not locked into "must work until 53 or fail." I have off-ramps at 41 (Coast number), 45 (decision point), and 50-52 (full FIRE).

Psychologically, this is huge. Knowing I *could* coast at 41 reduces the pressure to optimize every dollar.

## Advanced Concept: "Coast FIRE Plus" (The Hybrid Strategy)

Here's a strategy I'm planning that goes beyond basic Coast FIRE:

**Coast FIRE Plus = Coast number + part-time income covering expenses**

The idea:
1. Hit your Coast FIRE number
2. Reduce to part-time work that covers current expenses (~50% of current income)
3. Let your portfolio compound untouched
4. Enjoy 20-30 hours/week of work instead of 50-60

**My version:**

Once I hit $370K (Coast number), I'll:
- Cut roofing business to 15 hours/week (~$20K/year)
- Cover $69K annual expenses with part-time income ($20K) + investment income ($25K dividends/interest) + flexible gig work ($24K)
- Let the $370K grow untouched to $1.5M+ over 20-25 years
- Fully retire around 60-65 with way more than I need

**Why this works:**

I get freedom and flexibility *now* (age 41-45) without sacrificing full FIRE later. It's Barista FIRE + Coast FIRE combined.

## Calculating Your "Accelerated Coast" Number

What if you don't want to wait until 65? You can calculate an "Accelerated Coast" number for early retirement.

**Example: Coast to FIRE by 55 (instead of 65)**

**Assumptions:**
- Current age: 40
- Target early retirement: 55 (15 years away)
- FIRE number: $1,500,000
- Expected return: 6%

**Accelerated Coast Number = $1,500,000 ÷ (1.06)^15**
- (1.06)^15 = 2.3966
- **Accelerated Coast = $625,820**

**Comparison:**
- Coast to 65: Need $349,530 today
- Coast to 55: Need $625,820 today

**Difference:** $276K more needed to retire 10 years earlier.

**What this tells me:** If I want to retire at 55 instead of 65, I need to save significantly more before I can coast. But it's still way less than the full $1.5M.

## How to Use a Coast FIRE Calculator (Or Build Your Own)

### DIY Spreadsheet Method:

1. **Input your variables:**
   - Current age
   - Target retirement age
   - FIRE number (annual expenses × 25)
   - Expected return (4-8%)

2. **Calculate years to retirement:**
   - n = retirement age - current age

3. **Apply the formula:**
   - Coast Number = FIRE Number ÷ (1 + return)^years

4. **Run sensitivity analysis:**
   - Test with 4%, 5%, 6%, 7%, 8% returns
   - See how your Coast number changes

### Using Our Coast FIRE Calculator:

(I'm planning to build an interactive calculator for the site. It will let you input your numbers and see:
- Your Coast FIRE number
- How much more you need to save to reach it
- Timeline to hit Coast FIRE at your current savings rate
- Visual chart showing portfolio growth with vs. without additional contributions)

## Common Mistakes People Make with Coast FIRE

### 1. Using Too Aggressive Return Assumptions

**Mistake:** "I'll use 10% returns because that's the S&P 500 historical average!"

**Reality:** 
- 10% is *nominal* (includes inflation)
- Real returns are ~7% after inflation
- You need to use real returns for retirement planning
- Future returns may be lower than historical averages

**Fix:** Use 4-6% real returns for conservative planning.

### 2. Forgetting About Taxes

**Mistake:** Calculating Coast FIRE based on pre-tax accounts without considering future tax liability.

**Reality:** If your $350K Coast number is all in Traditional IRA, you'll owe taxes on withdrawals. Your *after-tax* Coast number is lower.

**Fix:** 
- If using Traditional IRA/401k: Multiply Coast number by 1.15-1.3 to account for future taxes
- Or focus on Roth + taxable accounts where Coast number = actual take-home

### 3. Not Accounting for Lifestyle Inflation

**Mistake:** Hit Coast FIRE, stop aggressive saving, then inflate lifestyle and dip into the portfolio.

**Reality:** Coast FIRE only works if you *don't touch the principal*. If you inflate spending and start withdrawing, you're undoing the compounding.

**Fix:** 
- Set a strict budget for living expenses
- Track expenses monthly
- Keep Coast portfolio in separate accounts you don't touch

### 4. Ignoring Healthcare Costs Pre-65

**Mistake:** Planning to Coast at 45 without budgeting for healthcare.

**Reality:** Healthcare costs $6K-$12K/year if you're not on employer insurance. That's a big chunk of part-time income.

**Fix:** Add healthcare costs to your "Coast FIRE expense budget" and ensure your part-time income covers it.

### 5. Overestimating Part-Time Income Sustainability

**Mistake:** "I'll just make $30K/year doing freelance work forever!"

**Reality:** Freelance/part-time income can dry up. Markets change. Your skills become outdated. Injury or illness happens.

**Fix:** Build a larger Coast number or a separate emergency fund. Don't assume part-time income is guaranteed.

## Coast FIRE vs. Other FIRE Variants

Let me compare Coast FIRE to the other major FIRE strategies:

| Strategy | Portfolio Needed | Work Required | Risk Level | Best For |
|----------|------------------|---------------|------------|----------|
| **Traditional FIRE** | 25-30× expenses | None (fully retired) | Low | People who can save aggressively and want full retirement |
| **Coast FIRE** | 10-15× expenses (depends on age) | Part-time to cover expenses | Medium | People with 15-25 years to retirement who want flexibility now |
| **Barista FIRE** | 15-20× expenses | Part-time for expenses + benefits | Medium | People who want to work part-time but reduce stress |
| **Lean FIRE** | 20-25× expenses (lower spending) | None | Medium-High | People willing to live frugally in early retirement |
| **Fat FIRE** | 30-40× expenses | None | Low | High earners who want luxurious retirement |

**Where Coast FIRE shines:** It's the lowest barrier to entry for meaningful flexibility. You don't need $1M+. You need $200K-$500K (depending on age) and the discipline to let it grow.

## When to Pivot from Coast FIRE to Full FIRE

Coast FIRE isn't necessarily the endgame. It's a milestone. Here's when you might decide to push from Coast to full FIRE:

### Pivot to Full FIRE if:

✅ **You get a windfall** (inheritance, business sale, stock options vest)  
Suddenly you're 70-80% to full FIRE. Push through the last bit and retire fully.

✅ **Part-time work becomes unsustainable** (health, burnout, market changes)  
If you can't rely on part-time income, you need the full FIRE number for safety.

✅ **Your expenses drop significantly** (paid off mortgage, kids finish college)  
Your FIRE number just decreased. You might already be at full FIRE without realizing it.

✅ **You're still energized and earning well**  
If you're enjoying work and earning $80K+ while coasting, you might as well accelerate to full FIRE and retire earlier.

### Stay at Coast FIRE if:

✅ **Part-time work is fulfilling and sustainable**  
If you genuinely enjoy your 20-hour/week gig and it covers expenses, why rush to full FIRE?

✅ **You value having structure and purpose**  
Some people *need* work for identity and routine. Coast FIRE gives you that without the grind.

✅ **You want to keep building wealth beyond FIRE**  
Maybe your goal isn't early retirement—it's financial security and optionality. Coast FIRE provides that.

## My Take: Coast FIRE Is the Late-Starter's Best Friend

Starting FIRE at 40, I don't have 20 years of compound growth ahead of me before I burn out.

Coast FIRE gives me a realistic milestone: $370K. That's achievable in 1-2 years at my current savings rate.

Once I hit it, I'll have options:
- Keep grinding if I'm energized
- Downshift to part-time if I'm burned out
- Pivot to a passion project that pays less
- Semi-retire and travel while doing remote contract work

The beauty of Coast FIRE is that it doesn't lock you into a single path. It's a safety net that says, "You've done enough. The rest is optional."

For late-starters, that psychological relief is priceless.

## Action Steps

1. **Calculate your full FIRE number** (annual expenses × 25 or your chosen multiplier)
2. **Determine your target retirement age** (65, 60, 55, etc.)
3. **Calculate years until retirement** (retirement age - current age)
4. **Run the Coast FIRE formula** with 4%, 5%, and 6% return assumptions
5. **Compare Coast number to current portfolio** — how far away are you?
6. **Calculate time to Coast FIRE** at your current savings rate
7. **Decide whether Coast FIRE is your goal** or just a milestone on the way to full FIRE
