Tax-loss harvesting (TLH) is one of those strategies that sounds sophisticated but is mostly about timing, recordkeeping, and understanding wash sale rules. As a business owner, TLH can be helpful — but only with the right setup.

What TLH does (in plain English)

- You sell investments that have declined to realize a capital loss.
- Losses offset capital gains and up to $3,000 of ordinary income each year; unused losses carry forward.
- The tax benefit is a function of your capital gains and ordinary income tax brackets.

Key limitation for self-employed: the wash sale rule

- The wash sale rule prevents replacing a sold security with a ``substantially identical`` one within 30 days (before or after) and still claiming the loss.
- If you sell an ETF and buy a different ETF that tracks the same index (but isn’t substantially identical), you can often stay invested without triggering wash sale — but be careful.

Practical TLH workflow I use

1. Quarterly review of portfolios for loss windows.
2. If I have gains elsewhere (realized or expected), I harvest matching losses.
3. Replace the sold position with a similar but not substantially identical ETF to stay invested (example: sell one total-market ETF and buy another provider’s total-stock ETF or an S&P 500 fund if appropriate).
4. Track trades in a spreadsheet and keep notes for tax time.

Tax examples (simplified)

- You harvest $10,000 of losses and have $8,000 of long-term gains for the year → $2,000 loss offsets ordinary income (or carries forward if you prefer to retain it for future gains).
- The effective tax benefit depends on whether you had long-term or short-term gains (short-term gains are taxed at ordinary rates).

Special considerations for self-employed investors

- If you have variable income, TLH can smooth taxable income across years — harvest more in high-income years.
- If you use tax-advantaged accounts (IRAs, 401ks), TLH only applies to taxable brokerage accounts.
- Avoid wash sales when you repurchase in a taxable account after selling the same ticker in a tax-advantaged account — that also triggers the rule.

When TLH isn't worth it

- Trading costs and bid-ask spreads can erase tax benefits for small losses.
- If you’re a passive investor with low turnover, simple buy-and-hold often beats frequent harvesting.

Practical tools and recordkeeping

- Use your broker's tax lot reporting and export CSVs each quarter.
- Tag harvested lots with notes: reason, replacement instrument, and wash-sale considerations.
- Consider automated services (tax-loss harvesting features in robo-advisors) if your portfolio is large enough.

Final thoughts

TLH is a useful lever for self-employed investors with taxable gains and variable income — but it’s not a substitute for a solid savings and tax strategy. If you want, I can add an example spreadsheet and a small TLH checklist download you can use during quarterly reviews.

Want me to wire up a download (CSV template) and add it to the post? I can create that next.
