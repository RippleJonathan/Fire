Tax-loss harvesting (TLH) sounds like one of those sophisticated Wall Street strategies that doesn't apply to regular people.

I thought the same thing until I calculated how much money I was leaving on the table.

Last year, I harvested $18,000 in losses from my taxable brokerage account. That offset $15,000 in capital gains from rebalancing and $3,000 of ordinary income. At my tax bracket, that saved me about $4,200 in federal taxes.

**That's real money.** That's a week of work I didn't have to do.

This post explains exactly what tax-loss harvesting is, how it works, the rules you need to follow (especially wash sale rules), and how to implement a system as a self-employed investor with variable income.

## What Is Tax-Loss Harvesting?

**Tax-loss harvesting** is the practice of selling investments that have declined in value to realize a capital loss, which can offset capital gains and reduce your taxable income.

### The Basic Mechanic:

1. **You own an investment that's down** (bought at $10,000, now worth $8,000)
2. **You sell it to "realize" the loss** ($2,000 capital loss)
3. **The loss offsets gains** (if you sold something else for a $2,000 gain, they cancel out)
4. **Excess losses offset ordinary income** (up to $3,000/year)
5. **Remaining losses carry forward** to future years

### Why It Matters for Self-Employed Investors:

If you're self-employed like me, you likely have:
- Variable income year-to-year
- Flexibility to time when you realize gains/losses
- Ability to strategically harvest losses in high-income years

**Example from my business:**

- 2023: Great year, $140K income → harvest losses to offset gains and reduce ordinary income
- 2024: Slower year, $85K income → let investments ride, don't harvest (lower tax benefit)

This flexibility is a tax planning superpower.

## How Tax-Loss Harvesting Saves You Money

### The Tax Benefit Calculation:

**Scenario:** You harvest $10,000 in losses.

**Option A: Offset $10,000 in short-term capital gains**  
- Short-term gains are taxed as ordinary income
- If you're in the 24% bracket: $10,000 × 24% = **$2,400 tax savings**

**Option B: Offset $10,000 in long-term capital gains**  
- Long-term gains are taxed at 15% (for most FIRE pursuers)
- Tax savings: $10,000 × 15% = **$1,500 tax savings**

**Option C: No gains to offset, use against ordinary income**  
- Limited to $3,000/year
- $3,000 × 24% = **$720 tax savings**
- Remaining $7,000 loss carries forward to next year

**Key insight:** Tax-loss harvesting saves the *most* when you have short-term gains to offset or high ordinary income.

### Real Example: My 2024 Tax Situation

**What happened:**
- Rebalanced my portfolio in March, selling some tech stocks that had run up → $12,000 short-term capital gain
- VTI (total market ETF) was down in October → sold $15,000 worth at a $4,000 loss
- Bought ITOT (iShares total market ETF) the next day to stay invested

**Tax result:**
- $12,000 short-term gain - $4,000 harvested loss = $8,000 net short-term gain
- Tax on $8,000 gain at 24% bracket = $1,920
- **Without TLH:** Would have paid 24% on $12,000 = $2,880
- **Tax savings: $960**

**Plus:** I stayed invested in the market. I just swapped one total-market ETF for another.

## The Wash Sale Rule (The Big Gotcha)

This is where most people screw up. The IRS has a rule to prevent abuse of tax-loss harvesting.

### The Wash Sale Rule:

**You CANNOT:**
- Sell a security at a loss
- Buy the same security (or a "substantially identical" security)
- Within **30 days before or after** the sale
- And still claim the loss

**The 61-day window:** 30 days before + day of sale + 30 days after = 61-day restricted period.

**What happens if you violate the wash sale rule:**
- The loss is disallowed
- The disallowed loss is added to the cost basis of the repurchased security
- You don't get the immediate tax benefit (it's deferred until you sell the replacement security)

### What Counts as "Substantially Identical"?

This is where it gets tricky. The IRS hasn't clearly defined "substantially identical," but general guidance:

**DEFINITELY substantially identical:**
- Same stock (sell AAPL, buy AAPL)
- Same bond (sell a specific Treasury bond, buy the same Treasury)
- ETF and mutual fund tracking the same index from the same provider (sell VOO, buy VFIAX — both Vanguard S&amp;P 500 products)

**PROBABLY NOT substantially identical:**
- Different providers tracking the same index (sell VOO (Vanguard S&amp;P 500), buy IVV (iShares S&amp;P 500))
- Different indexes (sell VTI (total market), buy VOO (S&amp;P 500))
- Similar but not identical sector ETFs (sell VGT (tech), buy XLK (tech, different holdings))

**GRAY AREA:**
- Leveraged vs. non-leveraged ETFs
- Different share classes of the same fund

**My rule:** If I'm not 100% sure, I swap to a different provider's ETF or a different (but correlated) index.

### Wash Sale Across Accounts (The Hidden Trap)

Here's something that surprises people: **The wash sale rule applies across ALL your accounts**, including:

- Taxable brokerage
- Traditional IRA
- Roth IRA
- Spouse's accounts

**Example of a violation:**

1. You sell VTI at a loss in your taxable brokerage (to harvest the loss)
2. Your auto-invest buys VTI in your Roth IRA 10 days later
3. **Wash sale triggered.** Loss disallowed.

**How to avoid this:**
- Pause auto-investments in tax-advantaged accounts during harvest season
- Swap to a different ETF in taxable while keeping the original ETF in retirement accounts
- Track purchases across all accounts

## My Tax-Loss Harvesting System (Step-by-Step)

Here's the exact process I use quarterly:

### Step 1: Quarterly Portfolio Review (Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct)

**What I do:**
1. Export holdings from my taxable brokerage (Fidelity)
2. Review each position and note:
   - Purchase date
   - Cost basis
   - Current value
   - Gain/Loss %
3. Identify positions with losses >5% (worth harvesting)

**Tool I use:** Fidelity's "Unrealized Gain/Loss" report (Accounts → Positions → Export CSV)

### Step 2: Check for Gain/Loss Offset Opportunities

**Questions I ask:**
- Did I realize any capital gains this year? (Check YTD realized gains in brokerage account)
- Do I expect to realize gains before year-end? (Rebalancing, stock comp vesting, crypto sales)
- Am I in a high-income year where the $3,000 ordinary income offset is valuable?

**If YES to any:** Proceed with harvesting.  
**If NO:** Consider waiting (unless I want to reset cost basis).

### Step 3: Select Replacement Securities

For each position I'm harvesting, I identify a suitable replacement that is:
- **Not substantially identical** (different provider or different index)
- **Highly correlated** (so I stay invested in the market)
- **Low cost** (expense ratio under 0.10%)

**My common swaps:**

| Original ETF | Replacement ETF | Why It's Safe |
|--------------|-----------------|---------------|
| VTI (Vanguard Total Market) | ITOT (iShares Core S&P Total US Stock Market) | Different provider, slightly different holdings |
| VOO (Vanguard S&amp;P 500) | IVV or SPY (iShares/SPDR S&amp;P 500) | Different provider, same index |
| VEA (Vanguard Developed Markets) | IDEV (iShares Core MSCI EAFE) | Different index (FTSE vs MSCI) |
| BND (Vanguard Total Bond) | AGG (iShares Core US Aggregate Bond) | Different provider |
| VNQ (Vanguard REIT) | IYR (iShares US Real Estate) | Different index composition |

**Why these work:** Different providers, different index methodologies, but highly correlated performance.

### Step 4: Execute the Harvest

**Process:**
1. Sell the losing position (morning, market order or limit order)
2. Wait for trade to settle (T+2 for stocks/ETFs)
3. Immediately (same day or next day) buy the replacement security
4. Set a calendar reminder for 31 days to swap back (optional)

**Important:** I don't wait to buy the replacement. I buy immediately to avoid being out of the market. Missing a few days of upside can wipe out the tax savings.

### Step 5: Record Everything

This is critical for tax time. I maintain a Google Sheet with:

| Date | Action | Ticker | Shares | Cost Basis | Sale Price | Gain/Loss | Replacement Ticker | Notes |
|------|--------|--------|--------|------------|------------|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| 10/15/24 | Sell | VTI | 50 | $10,500 | $9,800 | -$700 | ITOT | Harvested loss to offset Sept rebalance gains |
| 10/15/24 | Buy | ITOT | 50 | $9,800 | - | - | - | Replacement for VTI |

**Why this matters:** Your broker reports wash sales, but they only track trades within their platform. If you trade across multiple brokers or violate the wash sale rule in an IRA, *you* need to track it.

### Step 6: Year-End Reconciliation

In December, I:
1. Tally total harvested losses for the year
2. Compare to realized gains
3. Calculate the tax benefit
4. Decide if I want to harvest more before Dec 31 or let remaining positions ride

## Advanced Strategy: Tax-Loss Harvesting + Roth Conversions

Here's a powerful combo for self-employed FIRE pursuers:

### The Strategy:

1. **Harvest losses in your taxable brokerage** to offset gains and reduce ordinary income
2. **Use the tax savings to fund a Roth conversion** from your Traditional IRA
3. **Pay less tax on the Roth conversion** because you lowered your AGI with harvested losses

**Example:**

- You harvest $15,000 in losses
- You offset $10,000 in capital gains and $3,000 of ordinary income
- Your AGI drops by $3,000
- You convert $30,000 from Traditional IRA to Roth
- Because your AGI is $3,000 lower, you're deeper into the 12% bracket instead of the 22% bracket
- **Tax savings on conversion: ~$300-$600**

**Why this works for self-employed:**

In slow business years, my income drops. I use TLH to drop it even further, then convert Traditional IRA to Roth at rock-bottom tax rates.

## When Tax-Loss Harvesting Doesn't Make Sense

### Don't Harvest Losses If:

❌ **You're in the 0% long-term capital gains bracket**  
If your taxable income is under $47,025 (single) or $94,050 (married filing jointly) in 2024, your LTCG rate is 0%. Harvesting losses has no value.

❌ **You have no gains to offset and you're in a low tax bracket**  
If you're in the 10-12% bracket and have no capital gains, the $3,000 ordinary income offset saves you $300-$360. Probably not worth the hassle unless you have large carryforward losses.

❌ **You're close to the IRMAA threshold for Medicare premiums**  
If you're 63+ and your income is near the IRMAA cliff ($103,000 single, $206,000 married in 2024), reducing your AGI via TLH can save you $800-$2,000/year in Medicare Part B/D premiums. But if you're not near the cliff, it doesn't matter.

❌ **You're triggering short-term losses to offset long-term gains**  
Short-term losses first offset short-term gains, then offset long-term gains. If you harvest a short-term loss but only have long-term gains, you're using a 24% (ordinary income rate) loss to offset a 15% (LTCG) gain. You "wasted" 9% of the loss's value.

**Better:** Wait until you have short-term gains to offset.

❌ **The bid-ask spread and trading costs exceed the tax benefit**  
If you're harvesting a $200 loss but paying $15 in trading fees and losing $10 to bid-ask spreads, you're netting $175. At 24% tax rate, you save $42. You spent $25 to save $42. Barely worth it.

## Robo-Advisors with Automated TLH (Betterment, Wealthfront, etc.)

Many robo-advisors offer automated tax-loss harvesting. Here's how they work:

### How Automated TLH Works:

1. The robo monitors your portfolio daily
2. When a position drops below your cost basis, it automatically sells and buys a replacement ETF
3. It tracks wash sales across your account
4. It reports harvested losses on your tax forms

### Pros:
- ✅ Fully automated (you don't think about it)
- ✅ Harvests losses year-round, not just quarterly
- ✅ Can harvest small losses ($100-$500) that you might not bother with manually

### Cons:
- ❌ Advisory fees (0.25-0.50% annually) can outweigh tax savings
- ❌ Less control over which assets are sold and when
- ❌ Doesn't coordinate across accounts (can't see your Fidelity IRA or Robinhood account)
- ❌ May use weird replacement ETFs that drift from your intended allocation

### My Take:

**Robo-advisors make sense if:**
- You have $100K+ in taxable accounts
- You're in the 24%+ tax bracket
- You don't want to manage it yourself
- You can get low-cost automated TLH (Wealthfront, Betterment, Schwab Intelligent Portfolios)

**DIY makes sense if:**
- You have under $100K in taxable accounts (fee % outweighs benefit)
- You're comfortable executing trades quarterly
- You want full control over your portfolio
- You have accounts at multiple brokers (robo can't see them all)

**I do DIY** because I only have $45K in my taxable brokerage (most of my wealth is in SEP IRA and Roth IRA). The tax savings from quarterly manual harvesting ($500-$1,000/year) beats paying 0.25% annually ($110+/year).

Once my taxable account hits $150K+, I'll reconsider automated TLH.

## Special Considerations for Self-Employed Investors

### 1. Harvesting Losses in High-Income Years

As a self-employed person, my income varies wildly:
- Great year: $140K
- Slow year: $80K

**Strategy:** Harvest aggressively in high-income years (higher tax bracket = more value) and let positions ride in low-income years.

**Example:**
- 2023 (good year): Harvested $12K in losses → saved $2,880 in taxes (24% bracket)
- 2024 (slow year): Didn't harvest → kept positions, waiting for recovery

### 2. Coordinating TLH with Estimated Tax Payments

Self-employed people make quarterly estimated tax payments. TLH can reduce your Q4 estimated tax payment.

**How it works:**
1. Harvest losses in Oct-Dec
2. Reduce your projected taxable income
3. Lower your Q4 estimated tax payment (due Jan 15)

**Example:**
- I projected $120K income for 2024 → estimated tax payment of $8,000 in Q4
- Harvested $10K losses in November → projected income drops to $110K
- Adjusted Q4 payment to $7,000
- **Saved $1,000 in cash flow** that I can invest or use for expenses

### 3. Carryforward Losses for Future Gains

If you harvest more losses than you have gains, the excess carries forward indefinitely.

**My strategy:** In slow years, I harvest aggressively even if I don't have gains to offset. I build a "loss bank" to use in future high-income years.

**Current loss carryforward:** $8,400 (from 2022-2023)

**When I'll use it:** When I sell my business, sell real estate, or have a big capital gain event.

## Tax Forms and Reporting (What You Need to Know)

### Form 8949: Sales and Dispositions of Capital Assets

This is where you report every stock/ETF sale.

**What you need:**
- Date acquired
- Date sold
- Proceeds (sales price)
- Cost basis
- Gain or loss

Your broker (Fidelity, Schwab, Vanguard, etc.) sends you **Form 1099-B** with this info.

**Wash sales:** Your broker marks wash sales on the 1099-B with a "W" code. Those losses are disallowed.

### Schedule D: Capital Gains and Losses

This is the summary form that calculates:
- Total short-term gains/losses
- Total long-term gains/losses
- Net capital gain/loss
- Amount used to offset ordinary income (max $3,000)
- Carryforward losses to next year

### Form 1040: Where It Shows Up

The net capital gain/loss from Schedule D flows to **Line 7** of Form 1040 (your main tax return).

If you have a net loss, it reduces your total income. If you have a net gain, it increases your total income.

## Recordkeeping System (What I Actually Use)

### Tools:
1. **Google Sheets** — Master tracking spreadsheet (harvested losses, wash sales, carryforwards)
2. **Fidelity's Tax Center** — Download 1099-B, Unrealized Gain/Loss reports
3. **TurboTax Premier** — Imports 1099-B and generates Schedule D automatically

### Folder Structure:
```
Taxes/2024/
  ├── Brokerage_Statements/
  │   ├── Fidelity_1099B_2024.pdf
  │   ├── Fidelity_Realized_Gains_Losses.csv

  │   ├── TLH_Log_2024.xlsx
  │   ├── Wash_Sale_Checks.xlsx
  ├── Estimated_Tax_Payments/
  │   ├── Q1_Payment_Receipt.pdf
  │   ├── Q4_Adjusted_Calculation.xlsx
```

**Why this matters:** If you get audited (unlikely, but possible), you need to prove your cost basis and wash sale compliance. Keep records for 7 years.

## Real Tax Scenario: Putting It All Together

Let me walk through a full-year example using my actual 2024 numbers (simplified):

### Starting Position (Jan 2024):
- Taxable brokerage: $42,000
- Holdings: VTI, VOO, BND, VEA
- Projected income: $110,000 (self-employment)
- Tax bracket: 24% federal

### March 2024: Rebalancing Triggers Gains
- Sold 30% of VOO (up 25% from 2023) → **$6,000 short-term gain**
- Need to offset this or I'll owe $1,440 in taxes (24%)

### April 2024: Market Dip
- VEA (international stocks) down 8% from purchase
- Harvested $3,000 loss (sold VEA, bought IDEV as replacement)

### July 2024: Portfolio Review
- No positions with meaningful losses
- Skipped harvesting this quarter

### October 2024: Market Volatility
- BND (bonds) down 4% from purchase → harvested $2,000 loss (sold BND, bought AGG)
- VTI down 6% on one lot → harvested $1,500 loss (sold VTI, bought ITOT)

### Year-End Tally (Dec 2024):
- Harvested losses: $6,500 ($3K + $2K + $1.5K)
- Realized gains: $6,000 (from March rebalance)
- Net: $500 loss

**Tax result:**
- $6,000 gain - $6,500 loss = -$500 net loss
- Use $500 to offset ordinary income
- **Tax savings: $120** (24% of $500)

**Plus:**
- I stayed fully invested (swapped to equivalent ETFs)
- I have better diversification now (different providers)
- I reset my cost basis on the harvested positions (will grow tax-deferred until I sell)

**Not amazing, but not bad for 4 trades that took 30 minutes total.**

## Common Questions

### "Can I swap back to the original ETF after 31 days?"

Yes. After the 30-day window, you can sell the replacement ETF and buy back the original.

**Why you might do this:**
- You prefer the original provider (Vanguard vs. iShares)
- You want to consolidate holdings
- You're rebalancing anyway

**Why you might not:**
- The replacement ETF is basically identical (why bother?)
- You'd trigger another taxable event
- You'd pay trading fees again

**I usually don't swap back.** ITOT and VTI are 99.9% correlated. Not worth the effort.

### "What if I accidentally trigger a wash sale?"

If you violate the wash sale rule, the loss is disallowed but NOT lost. It's added to the cost basis of the replacement security.

**Example:**
- Sell AAPL at $10,000 (cost basis: $12,000) → $2,000 loss
- Buy AAPL 10 days later for $10,000
- Wash sale triggered → $2,000 loss disallowed
- New cost basis of the repurchased AAPL: $10,000 + $2,000 = $12,000

**Result:** You can't deduct the loss now, but you'll get it back when you sell the replacement (because your cost basis is higher).

**It's not the end of the world, but you lose the immediate tax benefit.**

### "Should I harvest losses every year, even if I don't have gains?"

**It depends.**

**Harvest if:**
- You expect gains in future years (building a loss bank)
- You're in a high tax bracket and the $3,000 ordinary income offset is valuable
- The position is unlikely to recover (you want to exit anyway)

**Don't harvest if:**
- You're in the 10-12% bracket (low tax benefit)
- You believe the position will recover quickly
- You'll violate the wash sale rule and lose the immediate benefit

**My approach:** I harvest losses most years to build carryforwards. Self-employment income is unpredictable, and I'd rather have losses ready to offset future gains.

## My Take: TLH Is Worth It, But Don't Obsess

I used to think tax-loss harvesting was only for rich people with $1M+ portfolios.

Then I did the math. Harvesting $10K-$15K in losses per year saves me $2,000-$3,000 in taxes. Over 10 years, that's $20,000-$30,000.

**That's real money.** That's a year of living expenses in retirement.

But here's the thing: **TLH is a bonus, not a core strategy.**

The core strategies are:
1. Save aggressively
2. Invest in low-cost index funds
3. Max out tax-advantaged accounts
4. Don't panic sell during downturns

TLH is the cherry on top. It's a 5-10% improvement, not a game-changer.

**My rule:** I spend 2-3 hours per year on TLH (quarterly 30-minute reviews). If it takes more time than that, the juice isn't worth the squeeze.

## Action Steps

1. **Open a taxable brokerage account** if you don't have one (Fidelity, Schwab, Vanguard)
2. **Set quarterly reminders** (Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct) to review unrealized gains/losses
3. **Create a tracking spreadsheet** to log harvested losses and replacement securities
4. **Identify your common ETF swaps** (VTI → ITOT, VOO → IVV, etc.)
5. **Pause auto-investments during harvest season** to avoid accidental wash sales
6. **Coordinate with your CPA or tax software** to report accurately on Schedule D
