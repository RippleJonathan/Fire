# Tax Optimization Strategies for FIRE

Taxes are one of the biggest expenses you'll face on your FIRE journey. Optimizing them can **accelerate your timeline by years** and **save hundreds of thousands of dollars**.

## The Tax-Advantaged Account Ladder

### 401(k) / 403(b)
**2024 Limits**: $23,000 ($30,500 if 50+)

**Benefits**:
- Reduces current taxable income
- Tax-deferred growth
- Often includes employer match (free money!)
- Creditor protection

**Strategy**: Max this out first, especially if you have an employer match.

### Traditional IRA
**2024 Limits**: $7,000 ($8,000 if 50+)

**Benefits**:
- Tax deduction (if income limits met)
- Tax-deferred growth
- Can convert to Roth later (see Roth conversion ladder)

**Income Limits** (2024):
- Single: Deduction phases out $77k-$87k
- Married: Deduction phases out $123k-$143k

### Roth IRA
**2024 Limits**: $7,000 ($8,000 if 50+)

**Benefits**:
- Tax-free growth forever
- Tax-free withdrawals in retirement
- Contributions can be withdrawn anytime penalty-free
- No RMDs (Required Minimum Distributions)

**Income Limits** (2024):
- Single: Phases out $146k-$161k
- Married: Phases out $230k-$240k

**Backdoor Roth**: If over income limits, contribute to Traditional IRA (non-deductible) and immediately convert to Roth.

### HSA (Health Savings Account)
**2024 Limits**: $4,150 single / $8,300 family

**Triple Tax Advantage**:
1. **Tax deduction** on contributions
2. **Tax-free growth**
3. **Tax-free withdrawals** for medical expenses

**FIRE Strategy**: 
- Max out HSA annually
- Pay medical expenses out-of-pocket now
- Save receipts forever
- Invest HSA funds aggressively
- Reimburse yourself in retirement (tax-free!)

**Why it's the best account**:
- After age 65, can withdraw for any reason (like a Traditional IRA)
- If used for medical, always tax-free
- No RMDs
- Rolls over indefinitely

### Mega Backdoor Roth
**Limit**: Up to $69,000 total in 401(k) for 2024

If your 401(k) allows:
1. Max regular 401(k): $23,000
2. Add after-tax contributions: Up to $69,000 total (minus employer match)
3. Immediately convert to Roth 401(k) or Roth IRA
4. Result: $40k+ additional Roth contributions!

**Requirements**:
- Employer plan allows after-tax contributions
- Employer plan allows in-service distributions or conversions

## The Roth Conversion Ladder

**The Problem**: Money in Traditional 401(k)/IRA is locked until 59½ (10% penalty if withdrawn early).

**The Solution**: Roth conversion ladder

### How It Works

1. **Retire early** with most money in Traditional 401(k)/IRA
2. **Each year**, convert $X from Traditional to Roth
3. **Wait 5 years** for that conversion to season
4. **Withdraw** the converted amount penalty-free and tax-free

### Example Timeline

**Year 1 (Age 40)**: Convert $50k from Traditional IRA to Roth
- Pay taxes on $50k (but you're in a low bracket since not working)

**Year 2 (Age 41)**: Convert another $50k
**Year 3 (Age 42)**: Convert another $50k
**Year 4 (Age 43)**: Convert another $50k
**Year 5 (Age 44)**: Convert another $50k

**Year 6 (Age 45)**: 
- Withdraw Year 1's $50k conversion (tax-free, penalty-free!)
- Convert another $50k

**Each subsequent year**: Withdraw last year's conversion, convert more.

### Key Rules

- **5-year rule**: Each conversion must season for 5 years
- **No penalties**: After 5 years, no early withdrawal penalty
- **No taxes on withdrawal**: Already paid when converting
- **Original Roth contributions**: Can withdraw anytime

### Optimizing Conversions

**Convert in low-income years**:
- First 5 years of retirement (before 5-year seasoning completes)
- Years with capital losses
- Years with large deductions

**Convert up to top of 12% bracket** (2024: ~$94k married):
- Standard deduction: $29,200
- Remaining space in 12% bracket: ~$65k
- Convert $65k, pay 12% = $7,800 in taxes
- Better than 22-24% bracket while working!

## Tax-Efficient Withdrawal Strategy

### The Withdrawal Order

**Phase 1: Early Retirement (Before 59½)**
1. **Taxable brokerage** account
2. **Roth IRA contributions** (penalty-free anytime)
3. **Roth conversion ladder** (after 5-year seasoning)
4. **72(t) SEPP** (Substantially Equal Periodic Payments) from Traditional IRA if needed

**Phase 2: Pre-Medicare (59½ to 65)**
1. **Traditional IRA** (no penalty after 59½)
2. **Roth IRA** if needed
3. **Keep taxable income low** to qualify for ACA subsidies

**Phase 3: Medicare Age (65 to 73)**
1. **Mix of Traditional and Roth** to manage IRMAA brackets
2. **Deplete Traditional** before RMDs start

**Phase 4: RMD Age (73+)**
1. **Required Minimum Distributions** from Traditional accounts
2. **Roth** to supplement
3. **Qualified Charitable Distributions** to reduce taxable RMDs

## ACA Health Insurance Optimization

For early retirees (before 65/Medicare), the **Affordable Care Act** provides subsidies based on income.

### Premium Tax Credits

**Magic number**: Keep MAGI between 100-400% of Federal Poverty Level

For a family of 4 (2024):
- **100% FPL**: $31,200 (minimum for subsidies)
- **400% FPL**: $124,800 (maximum for full subsidies)

**Strategy**: Control income through:
- Roth withdrawals (don't count as income!)
- Harvest capital losses
- Time Roth conversions
- HSA withdrawals for medical (don't count!)

**Example**:
- Show $40k MAGI through careful planning
- Get health insurance for $200/month instead of $2,000/month
- Save $21,600/year!

### Cost-Sharing Reductions

If income is 100-250% FPL:
- Lower deductibles
- Lower out-of-pocket maximums
- Significant savings on actual care

## Capital Gains Hacking

### 0% Capital Gains Rate

**2024 Limits**:
- Single: Up to $47,025 taxable income
- Married: Up to $94,050 taxable income

**Strategy**: Harvest gains tax-free every year!

**Example** (Married couple):
- Standard deduction: $29,200
- Remaining space: $64,850
- Sell stocks with $64,850 in gains
- Immediately rebuy (no wash sale rule for gains)
- Result: $64,850 in tax-free gains, reset cost basis!

### Tax-Loss Harvesting

**Strategy**: Sell investments at a loss to offset gains or income.

**Benefits**:
- Offset capital gains dollar-for-dollar
- Offset up to $3,000 of ordinary income
- Carry forward losses indefinitely

**Example**:
- Harvest $20k in losses during downturn
- Offset $3k of income each year for 6+ years
- Save $660/year in taxes

**Wash Sale Rule**: Can't rebuy "substantially identical" security within 30 days.

**Workaround**: 
- Sell VTI (Total Stock Market ETF)
- Buy ITOT (iShares Total Stock Market)
- Maintain market exposure, harvest loss

## Geographic Arbitrage for Taxes

### State Income Tax Matters

Moving from high-tax to no-tax state can save **5-13% annually**.

**High-Tax States**:
- California: 13.3%
- New York: 10.9%
- New Jersey: 10.75%

**No Income Tax States**:
- Florida, Texas, Nevada, Washington, Wyoming, South Dakota, Tennessee, Alaska, New Hampshire

**Example**: 
- Earn $100k in CA: Pay $13,300 state tax
- Earn $100k in TX: Pay $0 state tax
- Savings: $13,300/year!

### Establish Domicile Properly

To claim a new state:
- Get driver's license
- Register to vote
- Register vehicles
- Update mailing address
- Spend >50% of year there
- File homestead exemption if applicable

## Putting It All Together

### Sample FIRE Tax Plan

**Accumulation Phase (Ages 25-40)**
1. Max 401(k): $23k/year
2. Max HSA: $8,300/year (family)
3. Max Roth IRA: $7k/year (backdoor if needed)
4. Invest remaining in taxable brokerage

**Result at 40**:
- 401(k): $600k
- HSA: $200k
- Roth IRA: $150k
- Taxable: $300k
- Total: $1.25M

**Early Retirement Phase (Ages 40-45)**
1. Live on $60k/year from taxable brokerage
2. Each year: Convert $60k from Traditional to Roth
3. Pay ~$3k in taxes (12% bracket after standard deduction)
4. Harvest capital gains tax-free up to 0% bracket

**Phase 2 (Ages 45-59)**
1. Live on Roth conversions (after 5-year seasoning)
2. Continue converting Traditional to Roth
3. Keep MAGI low for ACA subsidies
4. Harvest gains at 0% when possible

**Phase 3 (Ages 60-72)**
1. Mix Traditional and Roth withdrawals
2. Manage income for IRMAA (Medicare surcharges)
3. Deplete Traditional before RMDs

**Phase 4 (Age 73+)**
1. Take RMDs
2. Use QCDs (Qualified Charitable Distributions) if charitable
3. Live on Roth as needed

## Advanced Strategies

### Qualified Charitable Distributions (QCD)

After age 70½:
- Donate up to $105k/year directly from IRA to charity
- Doesn't count as taxable income
- Satisfies RMD requirements
- Lowers AGI (helps with IRMAA, ACA, etc.)

### Substantially Equal Periodic Payments (SEPP/72t)

Access Traditional IRA before 59½ without penalty:
- Must take equal payments for 5 years or until 59½ (whichever is longer)
- Based on life expectancy
- Inflexible (can't change amount)
- Better to use Roth ladder if possible

## The Bottom Line

**Key principles**:
1. ✅ Max all tax-advantaged accounts
2. ✅ Use Roth conversion ladder for early retirement access
3. ✅ Keep income low in retirement for ACA subsidies
