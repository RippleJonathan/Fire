# Coast FIRE: The Middle Path to Financial Freedom

Not ready to fully retire, but tired of the grind? **Coast FIRE** might be your perfect middle ground.

## What is Coast FIRE?

**Coast FIRE** (Financial Independence Retire Early) is when you've saved enough that your current investments will grow to your full FIRE number by traditional retirement age—**without any additional contributions**.

Think of it as **financial cruise control**. You've done the heavy lifting early, and now you can coast.

## The Coast FIRE Formula

```
Coast FIRE Number = FIRE Number ÷ (1 + return rate)^years
```

### Real Example

Meet Alex, age 30:
- **FIRE number**: $1,000,000
- **Retirement age**: 65
- **Expected return**: 7% annually
- **Years to retirement**: 35

**Coast FIRE number**: $1,000,000 ÷ (1.07)^35 = **$93,663**

If Alex has $93,663 invested at age 30, they can stop saving entirely and still hit $1M by age 65!

## Why Coast FIRE is Powerful

### 1. Earlier Freedom
Instead of grinding for 15-20 years to full FIRE, you might reach Coast FIRE in just 5-10 years.

### 2. Career Flexibility
Once you hit Coast FIRE, you can:
- Take a lower-paying passion job
- Work part-time
- Start a risky business
- Take a sabbatical
- Move to a lower cost-of-living area

### 3. Reduced Pressure
No more obsessing over every dollar saved. As long as you cover living expenses, your retirement is secure.

### 4. Time Arbitrage
By leveraging compound interest and time, you trade intense early-career saving for decades of flexibility.

## The Coast FIRE Timeline

### Phase 1: Hustle Mode (Years 0-7)
- **Goal**: Hit Coast FIRE number
- **Savings rate**: 50-70%
- **Lifestyle**: Lean, focused, intentional
- **Career**: Maximize income

**Example**: Save $60k/year starting with $10k
- Year 7: ~$560k invested
- Coast FIRE achieved for $1M retirement at 65

### Phase 2: Coast Mode (Years 7-30+)
- **Goal**: Cover living expenses
- **Savings rate**: 0-20%
- **Lifestyle**: Balanced, flexible
- **Career**: Follow your passion

Your $560k grows to $1M+ by retirement without additional contributions.

### Phase 3: Traditional Retirement (Age 65+)
- Portfolio has grown to full FIRE number
- Withdraw 4% annually
- Full financial independence

## Coast FIRE Strategies

### Strategy 1: Geographic Arbitrage
After hitting Coast FIRE, move to a lower cost area.

**Example**: Software engineer in San Francisco
- Save aggressively for 7 years: $500k
- Move to Portugal, Thailand, or Austin
- Work remotely part-time: $40k/year
- Coast to full FIRE while enjoying life now

### Strategy 2: Career Pivot
Use Coast FIRE to fund a career change.

**Example**: Accountant hits Coast FIRE at $400k
- Quits corporate job
- Becomes a yoga instructor ($35k/year)
- Covers expenses, stops saving
- Portfolio grows to full FIRE

### Strategy 3: Part-Time Income
Work 20-30 hours/week instead of 50+.

**Benefits**:
- More time for family, hobbies, health
- Less stress and burnout
- Covers living expenses easily
- Retirement is on autopilot

### Strategy 4: Sabbatical Years
Alternate between working and not working.

**Pattern**:
- Work 2 years, save $50k
- Take 1 year off, live on $50k
- Repeat while Coast FIRE portfolio grows

## Coast FIRE vs Other FIRE Types

### Coast FIRE vs Lean FIRE
- **Lean FIRE**: Live on $30-40k/year, retire fully now
- **Coast FIRE**: Work part-time, full retirement later
- **Tradeoff**: Coast requires less savings, but you still work

### Coast FIRE vs Fat FIRE
- **Fat FIRE**: $2M+ portfolio, luxury retirement
- **Coast FIRE**: Smaller portfolio, normal retirement later
- **Tradeoff**: Fat FIRE takes longer, Coast gives flexibility sooner

### Coast FIRE vs Barista FIRE
- **Barista FIRE**: Part-time work covers expenses + provides benefits
- **Coast FIRE**: Part-time work covers expenses, but retirement is secured
- **Similarity**: Both involve continued part-time income

## Is Coast FIRE Right for You?

### You're a Good Fit If:
- ✅ You're young (20s-30s) with time for compound growth
- ✅ You want career flexibility soon
- ✅ You don't mind working part-time long-term
- ✅ You value experiences now over earlier full retirement

### You're NOT a Good Fit If:
- ❌ You want to fully retire ASAP
- ❌ You're closer to traditional retirement age
- ❌ You hate your career and need to quit immediately
- ❌ You want luxury retirement spending

## How to Reach Coast FIRE

### Step 1: Calculate Your Numbers
Use our [Coast FIRE Calculator](/calculators/coast-fire) to determine:
- Your Coast FIRE number
- How much you need to save
- When you'll reach it

### Step 2: Maximize Early Savings
- Increase income (promotions, side hustles, job hopping)
- Cut expenses aggressively
- Invest in low-cost index funds
- Max out tax-advantaged accounts

### Step 3: Track Progress
Monitor your Coast FIRE percentage:
```
Coast FIRE % = Current Savings ÷ Coast FIRE Number × 100
```

### Step 4: Plan Your Coast Life
Before hitting Coast FIRE, plan:
- What type of work will you do?
- Where will you live?
- What income do you need?
- What will you do with your time?

### Step 5: Make the Transition
Once you hit Coast FIRE:
- Give notice if changing jobs
- Negotiate part-time or remote work
- Build your new lifestyle gradually
- Keep emergency fund intact

## The Risks

### Market Downturns
A major crash early in your Coast phase can derail plans.

**Mitigation**:
- Build a cash cushion (1-2 years expenses)
- Have flexible income sources
- Consider a 3.5% Coast FIRE number instead of 4%

### Lifestyle Creep
Part-time work might not cover rising expenses.

**Mitigation**:
- Track spending carefully
- Distinguish needs from wants
- Keep living costs stable

### Career Changes
That "fun" job might become unfulfilling too.

**Mitigation**:
- Keep skills sharp
- Build multiple income streams
- Save extra in good years

## Real Coast FIRE Stories

- Saved $400k by age 30
- Quit consulting, became a freelance writer
- Earns $45k/year, works 25 hours/week
- Portfolio will hit $1.5M by 65

- Took 3-year sabbatical to travel
- Returned to part-time contract work

## The Bottom Line

Coast FIRE is the **Goldilocks** of financial independence:
- Not too aggressive (Lean FIRE)
- Not too slow (Traditional retirement)
- Just right for **early freedom with security**

It's about optimizing for **life satisfaction across all decades**, not just maximizing wealth or minimizing work years.

## My Take: Coast FIRE Feels Less Intimidating

I'll be honest—I haven't calculated my Coast FIRE number yet. I'm still in the early stages of my FIRE journey, and honestly, I'm probably far from hitting Coast FIRE right now. But the concept appeals to me way more than traditional FIRE.

Here's why: the pressure.

Full FIRE requires a massive nest egg—likely over $1 million for most people. That's a daunting target, especially when you're starting at 40 like me. Coast FIRE, though? That milestone comes *way* earlier. Even if I hit Coast FIRE and knew my retirement was secured if I just kept working at a reasonable pace, that would be a huge mental win.

The other thing that makes Coast FIRE attractive: I don't think I'd actually stop saving even if I hit it.

I run a roofing business, and I'm building other income streams (like this site and a CRM for contractors). I'm not the type to coast—I'd probably keep growing my net worth just because that's how I'm wired. But knowing that I *could* slow down if I wanted to? That's freedom.

What appeals to me most is the **reduced pressure**. I don't need to save 50-70% of my income every month and live like a monk. I can hit Coast FIRE, keep working on projects I care about, and know that even if things slow down, I'm not derailing my retirement.

I need to run the numbers (probably using our [Coast FIRE calculator](/calculators/coast-fire)), but I suspect Coast FIRE will be a key milestone for me. Not the finish line—just a checkpoint that says "you're good, now build from here."

If you're starting late like me, Coast FIRE might be the most motivating target to aim for first.
