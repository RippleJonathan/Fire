# Coast FIRE: The Middle Path to Financial Freedom

Not ready to fully retire, but tired of the grind? **Coast FIRE** might be your perfect middle ground.

## What is Coast FIRE?

**Coast FIRE** (Financial Independence Retire Early) is when you've saved enough that your current investments will grow to your full FIRE number by traditional retirement age—**without any additional contributions**.

Think of it as **financial cruise control**. You've done the heavy lifting early, and now you can coast.

## The Coast FIRE Formula

```
Coast FIRE Number = FIRE Number ÷ (1 + return rate)^years
```

### Real Example

Meet Alex, age 30:
- **FIRE number**: $1,000,000
- **Retirement age**: 65
- **Expected return**: 7% annually
- **Years to retirement**: 35

**Coast FIRE number**: $1,000,000 ÷ (1.07)^35 = **$93,663**

If Alex has $93,663 invested at age 30, they can stop saving entirely and still hit $1M by age 65!

## Why Coast FIRE is Powerful

### 1. Earlier Freedom
Instead of grinding for 15-20 years to full FIRE, you might reach Coast FIRE in just 5-10 years.

### 2. Career Flexibility
Once you hit Coast FIRE, you can:
- Take a lower-paying passion job
- Work part-time
- Start a risky business
- Take a sabbatical
- Move to a lower cost-of-living area

### 3. Reduced Pressure
No more obsessing over every dollar saved. As long as you cover living expenses, your retirement is secure.

### 4. Time Arbitrage
By leveraging compound interest and time, you trade intense early-career saving for decades of flexibility.

## The Coast FIRE Timeline

### Phase 1: Hustle Mode (Years 0-7)
- **Goal**: Hit Coast FIRE number
- **Savings rate**: 50-70%
- **Lifestyle**: Lean, focused, intentional
- **Career**: Maximize income

**Example**: Save $60k/year starting with $10k
- Year 7: ~$560k invested
- Coast FIRE achieved for $1M retirement at 65

### Phase 2: Coast Mode (Years 7-30+)
- **Goal**: Cover living expenses
- **Savings rate**: 0-20%
- **Lifestyle**: Balanced, flexible
- **Career**: Follow your passion

Your $560k grows to $1M+ by retirement without additional contributions.

### Phase 3: Traditional Retirement (Age 65+)
- Portfolio has grown to full FIRE number
- Withdraw 4% annually
- Full financial independence

## Coast FIRE Strategies

### Strategy 1: Geographic Arbitrage
After hitting Coast FIRE, move to a lower cost area.

**Example**: Software engineer in San Francisco
- Save aggressively for 7 years: $500k
- Move to Portugal, Thailand, or Austin
- Work remotely part-time: $40k/year
- Coast to full FIRE while enjoying life now

### Strategy 2: Career Pivot
Use Coast FIRE to fund a career change.

**Example**: Accountant hits Coast FIRE at $400k
- Quits corporate job
- Becomes a yoga instructor ($35k/year)
- Covers expenses, stops saving
- Portfolio grows to full FIRE

### Strategy 3: Part-Time Income
Work 20-30 hours/week instead of 50+.

**Benefits**:
- More time for family, hobbies, health
- Less stress and burnout
- Covers living expenses easily
- Retirement is on autopilot

### Strategy 4: Sabbatical Years
Alternate between working and not working.

**Pattern**:
- Work 2 years, save $50k
- Take 1 year off, live on $50k
- Repeat while Coast FIRE portfolio grows

## Coast FIRE vs Other FIRE Types

### Coast FIRE vs Lean FIRE
- **Lean FIRE**: Live on $30-40k/year, retire fully now
- **Coast FIRE**: Work part-time, full retirement later
- **Tradeoff**: Coast requires less savings, but you still work

### Coast FIRE vs Fat FIRE
- **Fat FIRE**: $2M+ portfolio, luxury retirement
- **Coast FIRE**: Smaller portfolio, normal retirement later
- **Tradeoff**: Fat FIRE takes longer, Coast gives flexibility sooner

### Coast FIRE vs Barista FIRE
- **Barista FIRE**: Part-time work covers expenses + provides benefits
- **Coast FIRE**: Part-time work covers expenses, but retirement is secured
- **Similarity**: Both involve continued part-time income

- ✅ You're young (20s-30s) with time for compound growth
