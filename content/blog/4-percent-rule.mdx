# The Math Behind the 4% Rule

The **4% rule** is the cornerstone of FIRE planning. But where does this number come from, and can you really trust it with your financial future?

## The Trinity Study

In 1998, three professors from Trinity University published a groundbreaking study analyzing historical stock and bond returns from 1926 to 1995. Their goal? Determine safe withdrawal rates for retirees.

### Key Findings

The study found that:

- **4% withdrawal rate** had a 95% success rate over 30-year periods
- A portfolio of **75% stocks / 25% bonds** performed best
- Lower withdrawal rates (3-3.5%) had near 100% success rates
- Market timing at retirement matters significantly

## The Math

Here's the simple calculation:

```
Annual Withdrawal = Portfolio Value × 0.04
FIRE Number = Annual Expenses × 25
```

If you need $40,000 per year in retirement:
- **FIRE Number**: $40,000 × 25 = **$1,000,000**
- **Annual Withdrawal**: $1,000,000 × 0.04 = **$40,000**

## Why 4% Works

The 4% rule works because:

1. **Historical market returns** average 7-10% annually
2. **Inflation** averages 2-3% annually
3. **Real returns** (after inflation) are around 7%
4. **4% leaves a buffer** for sequence of returns risk

## Important Considerations

### Sequence of Returns Risk

The order in which you experience returns matters. A market crash in year 1 of retirement is far more damaging than one in year 20.

**Example:**
- Portfolio A: -20%, +30%, +10% = Different outcome than
- Portfolio B: +10%, +30%, -20%

Even with identical average returns, Portfolio A suffers more due to early withdrawals during the crash.

### The 4% Rule Critiques

Modern critics argue:

- **Lower future returns**: Current market valuations suggest lower future returns
- **Longer retirements**: Early retirees need portfolios to last 40-50+ years, not 30
- **International diversification**: The study used only US markets
- **Current bond yields**: Near-zero rates weren't in historical data

### Adjustments for Early Retirement

For early retirees, consider:

1. **3.5% rule**: More conservative for 40+ year retirements
2. **Variable withdrawals**: Spend less in down years, more in up years
3. **Guard rails strategy**: Set upper/lower bounds for spending
4. **Flexible spending**: Distinguish needs vs wants

## Dynamic Withdrawal Strategies

### The Vanguard Method
Adjust withdrawals based on portfolio performance:
- Portfolio up 20%? Increase spending by inflation + 1%
- Portfolio down 20%? Freeze spending or cut discretionary items

### The Guardrails Approach
Set spending rules:
- Upper guardrail: If portfolio exceeds 30% above target, increase spending
- Lower guardrail: If portfolio drops 20% below target, cut spending

## The FIRE Sweet Spot

For most FIRE seekers, the optimal approach combines:

- **3.5-4% base withdrawal** rate
- **Geographic arbitrage** to reduce expenses
- **Flexibility** in spending during market downturns
- **Part-time income** in early years (Barista FIRE)
- **Tax optimization** to maximize withdrawal efficiency

## Real Example

Meet Sarah, age 35, targeting FIRE:

- **Annual expenses**: $50,000
- **FIRE number** (4% rule): $1,250,000
- **FIRE number** (3.5% rule): $1,428,571
- **Coast FIRE** (to age 65): ~$250,000 now

Sarah decides to:
1. Save aggressively to hit $250k by age 40 (Coast FIRE)
2. Continue to $1.3M by age 45 (using 3.75% rate)
3. Build in flexibility with a side hustle
4. Use guard rails for spending adjustments

## The Bottom Line

The 4% rule is a **guideline, not a guarantee**. Use it as a starting point, but build in:

- ✅ **Flexibility** in your spending
- ✅ **Backup income** sources
- ✅ **Conservative estimates** (3.5% for early retirement)
- ✅ **Dynamic adjustments** based on market performance
- ✅ **Tax efficiency** in withdrawals

Remember: The 4% rule has worked historically, but **your mileage may vary**. Plan conservatively, spend flexibly, and keep your options open.
