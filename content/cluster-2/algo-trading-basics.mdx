# Algorithmic Trading for Beginners

As a tech worker or engineer, you possess a unique advantage in the world of trading: **you can code**. Algorithmic trading (algo-trading) is the practice of using computer programs to execute trading strategies automatically, and it's more accessible than ever in 2024.

## What is Algorithmic Trading?

Algo-trading uses predefined rules and mathematical models to make trading decisions. Instead of manually clicking "buy" or "sell," your code does it for you based on:

- Price movements
- Technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands)
- Volume patterns
- Market microstructure
- Machine learning predictions

## Why Tech Workers Excel at Algo-Trading

### 1. Programming Skills
You already know Python, JavaScript, or another language. Trading APIs are just another REST endpoint.

### 2. Systems Thinking
Understanding data structures, algorithms, and system design translates directly to trading strategy design.

### 3. Statistical Knowledge
If you've worked with analytics, A/B testing, or ML, you understand probability and statistics - the foundation of profitable trading.

## The Algorithmic Trading Stack

### Languages
- **Python:** Most popular (pandas, numpy, backtrader)
- **JavaScript/TypeScript:** For web-based platforms
- **C++/Rust:** For ultra-low latency strategies

### Platforms & APIs
- **Alpaca:** Commission-free API for stocks
- **Interactive Brokers:** Professional-grade API
- **Binance/Coinbase:** Crypto trading APIs
- **QuantConnect:** Cloud-based backtesting

### Key Libraries
```python
import pandas as pd           # Data manipulation
import numpy as np            # Numerical computing
import backtrader as bt       # Backtesting framework
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi  # Live trading
```

## Basic Strategy: Simple Moving Average Crossover

One of the simplest algorithmic strategies:

**Rules:**
1. Buy when short-term MA crosses above long-term MA (Golden Cross)
2. Sell when short-term MA crosses below long-term MA (Death Cross)

**Pseudocode:**
```python
if SMA(20) > SMA(50) and position == 0:
    buy(quantity)
elif SMA(20) < SMA(50) and position > 0:
    sell(quantity)
```

## Risk Management is Everything

The difference between profitable algo-trading and blowing up your account:

### Position Sizing
Never risk more than 1-2% of capital per trade.

### Stop Losses
Automated exit points to limit downside.

### Diversification
Run multiple uncorrelated strategies.

### Backtesting
Test on historical data before risking real money.

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Overfitting
Your strategy works perfectly on historical data but fails in live trading. This is the ML equivalent of memorizing the training set.

### 2. Ignoring Transaction Costs
Commissions and slippage can turn a profitable backtest into a losing strategy.

### 3. No Risk Management
One bad trade can wipe out months of gains.

### 4. Latency Issues
For high-frequency strategies, even milliseconds matter.

## Getting Started: Your First Bot

**Week 1-2:** Learn the basics
- Set up a paper trading account (simulated)
- Familiarize yourself with trading APIs
- Understand market data formats

**Week 3-4:** Build a simple strategy
- Implement SMA crossover or RSI mean reversion
- Backtest on 2-3 years of data
- Calculate Sharpe ratio and max drawdown

**Week 5-6:** Paper trade
- Run your bot in simulation for 1 month
- Monitor performance daily
- Iterate and improve

**Week 7+:** Consider going live (small capital)
- Start with $500-1000
- Scale slowly as you gain confidence

## Resources for Engineers

- **QuantConnect:** Free cloud-based backtesting
- **Alpaca API:** Commission-free paper trading
- **r/algotrading:** Active community
- **QuantInsti:** Educational courses

## The Reality Check

Most retail algo-traders don't beat the market. High-frequency trading (HFT) is dominated by firms with millions in infrastructure. But as a learning exercise and side project, algo-trading teaches you:

- Financial markets mechanics
- Statistical thinking
- Real-world software engineering under constraints

And if you do find an edge? The returns can be life-changing.

## Conclusion

Algorithmic trading sits at the intersection of software engineering and finance - perfect for tech workers looking to apply their skills in a new domain. Start small, learn continuously, and never risk more than you can afford to lose.

The code is the easy part. The hard part is finding strategies that actually work.
