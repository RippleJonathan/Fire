# Algorithmic Trading for FIRE Seekers: A Primer

Algorithmic trading isn't just for Wall Street quants anymore. With the right approach, you can automate your investment strategy and focus on what matters—living your life.

## What is Algorithmic Trading?

Algorithmic trading uses computer programs to execute trades based on predefined rules. For FIRE seekers, this means:

- **Automated rebalancing**: Maintain your target asset allocation
- **Dollar-cost averaging**: Systematic investments regardless of market conditions
- **Tax-loss harvesting**: Automatically capture losses to offset gains

## The FIRE-Friendly Approach

Unlike day traders seeking quick profits, FIRE-focused algo trading emphasizes:

1. **Long-term growth**: 7-10 year+ horizons
2. **Low fees**: Minimize transaction costs
3. **Tax efficiency**: Maximize after-tax returns
4. **Passive management**: Set it and forget it

## Simple Algorithmic Strategies

### Strategy 1: The Rebalancer

```
IF portfolio drift > 5% from target allocation
THEN rebalance to target allocation
```

**Example**:
- Target: 70% stocks, 30% bonds
- Current: 75% stocks, 25% bonds
- Action: Sell 5% stocks, buy 5% bonds

### Strategy 2: The Momentum Tracker

```
IF 50-day moving average > 200-day moving average
THEN increase equity allocation by 10%
ELSE reduce equity allocation by 10%
```

### Strategy 3: The Value Investor

```
IF P/E ratio < historical average AND dividend yield > 3%
THEN allocate additional funds to value stocks
```

## Tools for Automation

### Robo-Advisors (Beginner-Friendly)
- Betterment: Tax-loss harvesting, auto-rebalancing
- Wealthfront: Direct indexing for $100k+ accounts
- Vanguard Digital Advisor: Low-cost Vanguard funds

### APIs for Developers
- Alpaca: Commission-free trading API
- Interactive Brokers API: Advanced features
- TD Ameritrade API: Comprehensive market data

## Risk Management

Algorithmic trading requires discipline:

1. **Backtesting**: Test strategies on historical data
2. **Position sizing**: Never risk more than 1-2% per trade
3. **Diversification**: Spread across asset classes
4. **Circuit breakers**: Halt trading during extreme volatility

## The Numbers

A simple rebalancing algorithm vs. buy-and-hold:

| Strategy | 10-Year Return | Volatility | Sharpe Ratio |
|----------|---------------|------------|--------------|
| Buy & Hold | 9.2% | 18% | 0.51 |
| Auto-Rebalance | 9.8% | 15% | 0.65 |

That extra 0.6% annually compounds to significant wealth over decades.

## Getting Started

1. **Start simple**: Begin with a robo-advisor
2. **Learn the basics**: Understand your algorithm before deploying it
3. **Monitor performance**: Review quarterly, not daily
4. **Stay the course**: Algorithms work best when left alone

## Warning Signs

Avoid these pitfalls:
- Over-optimization (curve fitting)
- Excessive trading (tax inefficiency)
- Emotional override (defeating the purpose)
- Ignoring fees (they compound negatively)

## The FIRE Advantage

Algorithmic trading aligns perfectly with FIRE principles:
- **Passive income**: Let computers manage your wealth
- **Time freedom**: No need to watch markets daily
- **Consistency**: Removes emotional decisions
- **Scalability**: Same strategy works for $10k or $10M
