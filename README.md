# 🚀 Velocity FI: The Futuristic Financial Independence Engine

**Status:** Active Development
**Stack:** Next.js 14 (App Router) | Tailwind CSS | TypeScript | MDX
**License:** MIT

## 📜 Mission
Velocity FI is not a traditional blog. It is a high-performance content engine designed to dominate the "Financial Independence, Retire Early" (FIRE) niche. Our goal is to demystify wealth building through a data-driven, algorithmic approach, presented in a blazing-fast, futuristic UI.

We target the "High-Intent" financial demographic: tech workers, engineers, and optimizers who value speed, accuracy, and efficiency over fluff.

## ⚡ Tech Stack & Architecture
This project is built for **Core Web Vitals** perfection (100/100 Lighthouse Score).

* **Framework:** [Next.js 14](https://nextjs.org/) - For server-side rendering and instant transitions.
* **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility-first styling for a "Cyberpunk/Clean" aesthetic.
* **Content:** [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) - Markdown with embedded React components. This allows us to put interactive Compound Interest Calculators directly inside blog posts.
* **SEO:** Programmatic SEO architecture with automated JSON-LD Schema generation for "Finance" and "Article" types.
* **Analytics:** Privacy-focused server-side analytics (avoiding ad-blockers).
