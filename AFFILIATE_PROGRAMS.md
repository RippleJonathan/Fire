### ✅ **DO:**

- Add disclosure: "This post contains affiliate links. If you sign up, I may earn a commission at no cost to you. I only recommend products I use or have researched."
- Include in footer of every post with affiliate links
- FTC compliance (legally required)

**2. Add value first:**
- Explain WHY you recommend it
- Compare options (not just one affiliate link)
- Share your personal experience or plan to use it

**3. Make it natural:**
- Example: "When I transition my portfolio to index funds, I'm planning to use M1 Finance because of their automated rebalancing and tax-loss harvesting features. [Open an M1 Finance account here](#)."

**4. Use text links in context:**
- Link relevant keywords ("Personal Capital wealth tracker")
- Not: "Click here!!!" or "Best offer!!!"

### ❌ **DON'T:**

**1. Don't be pushy:**
- Avoid: "YOU MUST SIGN UP NOW!"
- Avoid: "This is the ONLY option!"

**2. Don't hide affiliate status:**
- Legally required to disclose
- Damages trust if people find out later

**3. Don't recommend crap:**
- Only promote what you'd genuinely recommend
- Your reputation > short-term commission

**4. Don't overdo it:**
- Max 3-5 affiliate links per blog post
- Focus on quality over quantity
