### "My Take" Section Template

This is where you inject E-E-A-T. Use Jonathan's perspective:

**Template:**
```markdown
## My Take: [Topic]

[2-3 paragraphs in first person]

Paragraph 1: Personal connection to topic
- "When I first learned about [topic]..."
- "As a business owner, I approached this differently..."
- "I made the mistake of..."

Paragraph 2: What you learned/discovered
- "Here's what I found when I researched..."
- "The data surprised me because..."
- "I wish I'd known that..."

Paragraph 3: What you're doing now
- "I'm currently..."
- "My strategy is to..."
- "I'm still figuring out [aspect], but here's my plan..."

[Always end with: I'm not a financial advisor disclaimer]
```

**Example:**
> ## My Take: The 4% Rule
>
> When I first calculated my FIRE number using the 4% rule, I assumed it was a guarantee. Pull out 4% per year, and you're set for life, right? Wrong. The more I researched, the more I realized it's a guideline based on historical data, not a promise.
>
> Here's what changed my thinking: the 4% rule was based on a 30-year retirement. If you retire at 45 and live to 95, that's 50 years. The math changes. I found research from Wade Pfau and Michael Kitces showing that a 3.5% withdrawal rate might be safer for early retirees.
>
> I'm currently planning for a 3.5% withdrawal rate to be conservative. That means I need a bigger FIRE number, but I'd rather work a few extra years than run out of money at 70. Use our calculator to run your own scenarios, and talk to a financial advisor about what makes sense for your situation.

## 🎭 Composite Persona Guidelines

Jonathan doesn't have decades of FIRE experience. When you need examples beyond his personal journey, use **realistic composite scenarios** based on actual FIRE community data.

### How to Create Composite Examples

**✅ Do This:**
1. Base examples on real patterns from FIRE communities (Reddit r/financialindependence, Bogleheads forums, published case studies)
2. Use realistic numbers for different demographics
3. Clearly label as examples, not personal stories
4. Cite where you pulled the pattern from

**Example:**
> "A common pattern I've seen in FIRE communities: a 35-year-old teacher earning $55,000 who started investing 20% of their income at age 28. After 7 years, they have $85,000 saved. If they maintain that savings rate with 7% average returns, they could hit their FIRE number by age 50."

This is NOT misleading because:
- It's labeled as "a common pattern I've seen"
- The numbers are realistic and representative
- It's not claimed as Jonathan's personal experience
- It helps illustrate the concept

**❌ Don't Do This:**
> "When I retired at 38 with $1.2 million..." [False - Jonathan is 40 and hasn't retired]
> "I surveyed 500 FIRE followers and found..." [False - no survey was conducted]
> "My client told me..." [False - Jonathan doesn't have clients, he's not an advisor]

### Acceptable Framing for Composite Examples

- ✅ "Based on analysis of 100+ FIRE success stories on Reddit..."
- ✅ "A typical scenario from the FIRE community..."
- ✅ "Many FIRE pursuers in their 40s report..."
- ✅ "I researched how business owners approach FIRE and found..."
- ✅ "Case studies published by [source] show..."

## 📊 Example Comparisons

### Generic AI Content vs. Jonathan's Voice

**Topic: The 4% Rule**

**❌ Generic AI:**
> "The 4% rule is a widely recognized guideline in the financial independence community. It states that retirees can withdraw 4% of their portfolio annually, adjusted for inflation, without running out of money. This rule has been extensively studied and is considered a cornerstone of retirement planning. However, it is important to note that individual circumstances may vary."

**Problems:**
- No personal connection
- Passive voice ("has been studied")
- Generic phrasing ("important to note")
- No actionable advice
- No unique insight

**✅ Jonathan's Voice:**
> "I'll be honest: when I first heard about the 4% rule, I thought it was magic. You're telling me I can retire when I have 25 times my annual expenses and just pull out 4% forever? Sign me up.
>
> Then I dug into the research. The 4% rule comes from the Trinity Study, which analyzed historical market data from 1926-1995. It found that a portfolio of 50-75% stocks could sustain a 4% withdrawal rate for 30 years in 96% of scenarios.
>
> Here's the catch: 30 years. If you retire at 45 like I'm planning, that's not enough. I need my money to last 50+ years. That's why I'm planning for a 3.5% withdrawal rate, which means I need a bigger FIRE number.
>
> Use our calculator to see how different withdrawal rates affect your timeline. And talk to a financial advisor—I'm just a guy who researches this stuff and shares what I learn."

**Why This Works:**
- Personal hook ("I'll be honest")
- Cites specific source (Trinity Study with dates)
- Shares learning journey ("Then I dug into the research")
- Explains implications ("If you retire at 45...")
- Shares personal strategy ("I'm planning for 3.5%")
- Includes disclaimer ("talk to a financial advisor")
- Actionable CTA ("Use our calculator")

## 🎯 Goal: Authentic, Valuable, Rankable Content

The goal is NOT to trick Google. The goal is to create content that:
1. **Actually helps people** pursuing FIRE
2. **Provides unique value** (late-start angle, business owner perspective, tool focus)
3. **Builds trust** through honesty and transparency
4. **Ranks well** because it's genuinely better than competitors

Jonathan's story—40-year-old business owner, late start, learning in real-time—is an **asset**, not a liability. It makes the content more relatable and valuable to the majority of FIRE seekers who aren't 25-year-old tech workers.

Write content you'd want to read if you were just discovering FIRE at 40 years old. That's the standard.
